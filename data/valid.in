OKAY YEAH  </s>
OKAY TWO  </s>
AND AND FOR A <unk> UH TELETEXT YOU NEED ADDITIONAL BUTTONS AS WELL SO I KIND OF NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE UH NEED  </s>
BAD ANSWER RIGHT  </s>

UH-HUH  </s>
IT'S TRUE  </s>
IS QUITE EASY YEAH  </s>
SO FROM UH UM MY ANALYSIS OF THAT KIND OF DIALOGUES I COULD SAY THAT THERE'S ONLY THERE ONLY FOUR BASIC UH EXCHANGES DEPEND ON THE INFORMATION UH DIRECTION OF THE INFORMATION FLOW  </s>
I GIVE ME A LOWER PRICE GIVE ME A HIGHER PRICE GIVE ME SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY  </s>
UH MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE THE COLOURS THAT AT LEAST THE FRAME  </s>

MM-HMM  </s>
SURE  </s>
I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE PLAYFUL AND SILLY SORT OF HAVE A GOOD TIME  </s>
UM FOR THE BUTTONS I THOUGHT WE'D PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH JUST HAVING THE STANDARD UM PUSH BUTTONS RATHER THAN THE SCROLL WHEEL  </s>
YEAH  </s>
I WASN'T VERY IMPRESSED BY THEM AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO RE UH NOTHING I SAW SEEMED TO MEET THE SORTS OF DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING FOR TODAY  </s>
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO LEAN DOWN TO GET IT  </s>
YOU PRESS THE BUTTON IT MAKES A NOISE RIGHT  </s>
DON'T YOU  </s>
YEAH  </s>
I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW TO TRY TO <unk>  </s>
AND I DON'T THINK EVERYONE'S GONNA BUY A REAL REACTION T. V. WITHIN A MONTH AFTER THE RELEASE OF OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL  </s>
OH GOSH NO EMISSION <unk> OKAY SO I'VE HIGHLIGHTED THIS IN <unk> RED AND THEN THE WHOLE THING IN GREEN BECAUSE TYPE TWO <unk> GALAXIES ARE ONE  </s>

THERE'S A LOT OF SMALL UH ELECTRONICS  </s>
AND I I'D MM SORRY  </s>
AND UH THE SCREEN LIGHT BLUE  </s>
SORRY DO YOU WANT THAT BACK UP  </s>
AND OF COURSE OUR VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM WHICH I'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ALREADY AND UH THE USE OF <unk> COLOURS AND SHAPES TO AID RECOGNITION OF THE FEATURES UM THAT ARE AROUND SO  </s>
THINK THEY'RE JUST CALLED FACE PLATES  </s>
HELP  </s>
OKAY  </s>
SO ITS MAIN PURPOSE IN FACT IS A BACK LIGHT WHICH CHANGE COLOURS WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO FIND  </s>
IT'S THE UM IT LOOKS LIKE A Y. KIND OF OVER THERE ABOVE DRAW  </s>
I <unk> I I THINK I CAN DO THAT FAIRLY QUICKLY BECAUSE I HAVE THE ALGORITHMS  </s>
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE'LL PROBABLY BE QUITE TIGHT FOR TIME AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT A LOT YOU'D LIKE TO SAY I GUESS  </s>
YEAH  </s>
I PRETTY MUCH LIKE A DOLPHIN BECAUSE OF ITS UH ITS FREEDOM BASICALLY  </s>

YEAH  </s>
YOU CAN INSERT A NEW UM SLIDE OR OR WHITE BOARD UH UH FILE UM BY EITHER USING THE INSERT FUNCTION OR BY CLICKING THE NEXT BUTTON OR THE BLANK BUTTON  </s>

OH  </s>
HERE'S OUR DESIGNER  </s>
AND OF COURSE SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN AVOIDING TALKING ABOUT 'CAUSE OF WE'VE NO INFORMATION IS SELLING THEM DIRECTLY TO THE MANUFACTURERS  </s>
YEAH  </s>
MM-HMM  </s>
THAT'S LIKE MINE IT WAS LIKE WOULD YOU PREFER AN L. C. D. SCREEN OR A <unk> REMOTE CONTROL  </s>
YEAH  </s>
MEANS EQUIVALENT WIDTHS YEAH  </s>

THE THE LOOK AND THE COLOUR IS SOMETHING WHICH IS COOL  </s>
SO  </s>
MM-HMM  </s>
AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE  </s>

OKAY  </s>
YEAH  </s>
THERE WAS A LOT OF SYNERGY  </s>
YOU CAN UH KNOW  </s>
YEAH OKAY  </s>
YES  </s>
OH  </s>
SO YOU COMPUTE D. C. T. RIGHT FROM SIGNAL  </s>
AND WE DID THAT BY SORT OF GIVING THEM A QUESTIONNAIRE THAT WE'D PREPARED AND ASKING THEM TO FILL IN THE ANSWERS  </s>
THEN WE HAVE SOME MONEY LEFT  </s>
BECAUSE UM MAYBE WE CAN START WITH THE TECHNICAL UH FUNCTIONS  </s>
UM WE'RE LOOKING FOR A DEVICE  </s>
NOWADAYS IT'S NOT THE CASE  </s>
YEAH  </s>
I MEAN IS IS IS TAKING TIME FOR THE MATERIAL AND SO ON  </s>
YES WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT I GUESS  </s>
DIFFERENT  </s>
YEP  </s>

YEAH  </s>
BUT  </s>
UH  </s>
YEAH  </s>
YEAH NO IT'S WHAT I ALREADY SAID  </s>
SO ANYWAY YEAH WE COULD DO SOME I DO SOME WORK NOW ON ON THE DESIGN FOR EXAMPLE  </s>
OH OKAY  </s>

AND THAT MAKES ME SPECIAL  </s>
MM-HMM  </s>
OKAY  </s>
YEAH  </s>

THAT IT'S IT'S FASHIONABLE  </s>
YEAH  </s>
YEAH  </s>
UH SO UM UM I'M THE INTERFACE DESIGNER IN THIS PROJECT AND MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL  </s>
BUT IT  </s>
SO THESE ARE IMPORTANT NUMBERS THAT MATTHEW AND I NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FOR OUR FUNCTIONAL UM  </s>
SO LE LE LET'S SEE  </s>
ANY NEW IDEAS WITH REGARD TO REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS  </s>
THE NEW GENERATION ONES WHERE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY BUTTONS ON THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT  </s>
UM DO WE HAVE UM  </s>
THAT'S TRUE BUT ARE WE SET ON THE BANANA  </s>
THERE THE ICONS  </s>
YEAH YEAH  </s>
UM  </s>
BUT LIKE IT NEEDS DO SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW IS NEW  </s>

THEN <unk> BLIND DON'T WATCH T. V.  </s>
DON'T <unk> DON'T SOUND DON'T SOUND FAMILIAR  </s>
IS IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY <unk> LIKE TO ENUMERATE OVER  </s>
UH HE WOULDN'T HAVE SENT IT JUST TO ME WOULD HE  </s>
YEAH I AGREE  </s>
ELECTRONICS  </s>
SO MULTI COLOURED BUTTONS  </s>
AND WE CAN PUT THAT ON A <unk> OR WE CAN DO IT SOME OTHER WAY  </s>
NEXT MEETING UH HERE ARE THE TASK YOU HAVE TO WORK ON  </s>
IN THE FUNCTION DESIGN PHASE I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION  </s>
IF YOU GET THAT FAR  </s>
THE DIFFERENT DESIGNS  </s>
NO  </s>
WELL MY <unk> IS  </s>
LIKE IF PEOPLE START IMPLEMENTING LIKE SOME PEOPLE PROPOSE SOMETHING IN FEATURE LEVEL SOME PROPOSE IN SOMETHING IN MODEL LEVEL BUT THESE TWO ARE REALLY INDEPENDENT NO  </s>
NEE UH ONE OF THE FOUR UH  </s>
MM-HMM  </s>
EIGHT  </s>
BUT HOPEFULLY THE THAT'LL BE DONE DURING THE FIRST PASS BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT  </s>
LIKE THIS YEAH MM MM MM OKAY  </s>
REAL REACTION  </s>
WE'RE ENTERING A NEW MARKET HERE SO I THINK THE THE PROFIT EXPECTATION FOR THIS ONE PRODUCT IS MAYBE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS BEING ABLE TO  </s>
YEAH YEAH YEAH  </s>
WELL LIKE SAY YOU HAD UM LIKE SAY FOR A MEETING RIGHT YOU'VE GOT LIKE UH SAY A HIERARCHY THAT LOOKS QUITE BIG LIKE THIS  </s>
AS WE HAVE SEEN EARLIER THE  </s>
BUT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW WHICH ONE OF THE ONES THEY'RE MEANT TO REPLACE  </s>
OOH  </s>
WE  </s>
I THINK THE EASY TO USE UH ASPECT IS DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE  </s>
WHERE WHERE  </s>
MODEL TWO AND MODEL THREE AND THEREFORE YOU CAN SUB DIVIDE YOUR MARKET UP  </s>
TWO  </s>
ALSO FOR THE FOR THE MORE UH YEAH FOR THE PEOPLE  </s>
GREAT  </s>
WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE  </s>
UH WELL THIS IS UH THE BASIC UH FUNCTION OF A REMOTE  </s>
ONE POSSIBILITY IS TO DOWNLOAD PROGRAM INFORMATION INTO THE L. C. D. SCREEN SO THAT INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY SAYING I WANT TO I WANT TO GO TO CHANNEL THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE I KNOW THIS <unk> ON  </s>
BOO HOO  </s>
YEAH  </s>
OKAY  </s>
OKAY  </s>
YEAH BUT WE WE DON'T WE'RE NOT AIMING A COMMAND FOR THAT  </s>
AND THE RESULTS FROM THAT WERE ALMOST THE SAME AS WHAT WE GOT FOR THE C. T. S. MODEL  </s>
AND FIRST UM  </s>
BUT TO GET A CLUSTER THE LOCATION THAT IS UH A PLACE WHERE UH NOISE IS REGULARLY COMING FROM  </s>
BECAUSE THE DEFINITION  </s>
YEAH  </s>
I THINK ALL THESE THINGS ARE PRETTY STANDARD  </s>
AS THE COLOUR THE  </s>

SO BASICALLY YOUR YOUR <unk> IS TRAINED ON SOMETHING THAT WAS DERIVED OFF PENN TREE BANK  </s>
YEAH THAT'S TRUE  </s>
WE'VE ALL HAD IT ONCE I WANT TO WATCH SOME TELEVISION WHERE'S THE REMOTE CONTROL  </s>
BUT CAN WE <unk> UH UH  </s>
YEAH BUT THE THE THING IS IT IT ISN'T SIMPLY AN ACT OF SETTING A STRING DEFAULT TOOL TIP  </s>
MM-HMM  </s>
THAT'S QUITE GOOD  </s>
OKAY SO NOW UH WE'RE MOVING ON TO FINANCE OKAY  </s>
YEAH  </s>
MM-HMM  </s>
I THOUGHT BUT THIS IS REALLY YOUR DEPARTMENT THAT WE NEED JUST THE FUNCTIONAL DISPLAY AND FOUR <unk>  </s>
IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IT SEEMS TO BE LIGHT  </s>
CERTAIN  </s>
MAYBE YOU CAN UH FIND IT IN YOUR EMAIL RIGHT NOW THEN WE KNOW THEN WE EXACTLY KNOW WHAT IT WILL COST US  </s>
YEAH  </s>
IF THIS IS ONLY GONNA BE A YOU KNOW SATELLITE CABLE T. V.  </s>
TRUE  </s>
YEAH YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PRODUCT COST WON'T BE MAXIM MORE THAN TWELVE DOT FIFTY EUROS  </s>
YEAH  </s>
MM-HMM  </s>
YEAH  </s>
I WAS I WAS SATISFIED WITH WITH THE LEADERSHIP YEAH  </s>
UH THE SENDER WILL PUSH THE BUTTON THE CHIP WILL RESPOND UH AND THEN THE DIG DIGITAL SIGNAL IS SENT TO THE T. V.  </s>
SO THE DOES REMOTE LOOK AND FEEL FASHIONABLE TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT  </s>
THEN UM OF COURSE SHINES INFRARED LIGHT ONTO THE TELEVISION WHICH THEN WILL <unk> WHAT SIGNAL UM IT'S GETTING AND WILL DO WHAT YOU TELL IT  </s>
I SAY NEITHER OF THEM  </s>
IS EVERYBODY KIND OF HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE DOING  </s>
WELL IF I IF YOU SEE A STRANGE SHAPE LYING SOMEWHERE UH THEN YOU'D UH <unk> IT AS WHOA THAT IS STRANGE  </s>
UH  </s>
LIKE THREE D.  </s>
YEAH PLUS IF ANYTHING THAT IS SPECIAL FORMS MAKES IT SLIGHTLY EASIER TO  </s>
SAY YOUR REMOTE CONTROL GAVE ME REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY  </s>
THAT'S HANDY  </s>
I MEAN I I WELL WE <unk> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER END NOW  </s>
YES  </s>
YOU'LL FIND THE NEXT MINUTES ALSO THERE  </s>
SURE  </s>
PEOPLE ALSO ZAP LIKE TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL ABOUT UM SIXTY FIVE PER CENT DURING AN HOUR OF USE  </s>
UH BECAUSE IF WE MAKE <unk> COVERS IT HAS TO BE ONE OF THOSE MAT MATERIALS  </s>
I DON'T KNOW  </s>
YEAH  </s>
THEN MARKETING STRATEGY OF THE COMPANY  </s>
OKAY  </s>

MM  </s>
SO THAT'S WHY I GUESS WE DON'T FOLLOW THAT SOLUTION  </s>
WHICH YOU CAN <unk> SO YOU CAN UH STILL PUT ANOTHER NUMBER ON IT  </s>
OR NOT  </s>
OKAY  </s>
YES WELL WE'LL GET IT TO HEAR THAT I THINK  </s>
YEAH  </s>
SO IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE HAVE ONE FOR ALL  </s>
SO THE RE BASICALLY THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL BE YOU KNOW INFRARED CONTROL SO THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO RELATE THE  </s>
SHOULD WE LEAVE NOW BRIAN  </s>
YEAH  </s>
EXPORT  </s>
NO  </s>
UH BUT UH YEAH  </s>
YEAH BUT DO THEY AUTOMATICALLY WRITE TO THE FILE ANYWAY I'LL I'LL FIGURE THAT OUT  </s>
OR I DUNNO  </s>
OKAY UM  </s>
UH I TH I THINK YO WE HAVE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE TO GET A WHOLE MARKET  </s>
RIGHT  </s>
UM BADGER  </s>
MANGO  </s>
I DON'T KNOW  </s>
AND IF WE ARE CHOOSING UM SOLAR CELLS THEN WE CAN'T CHOOSE LATEX FOR THE CASE MATERIAL SO WE JUST HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT  </s>
NO THAT'S A THAT'S A CATCHY SLOGAN  </s>
I MADE UH UH MY OWN MAP  </s>
YEP  </s>
BUT THE THE GEAR YEAH YOU KNOW THAT CREATES BOUNDARIES TO THAT UM AND AND THE TIME THE TIME GIVEN ALSO RESTRICTS  </s>
WHAT WOULD BE A MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING IT  </s>
AND EVEN KIND OF ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LOSING LOSING THE REMOTE WHAT WE WERE SAYING IT'S A COMMON ISSUE  </s>
IF IT WAS DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBERS THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT  </s>
UH AS I'M A MORE AN ARTIST THAT'S GONNA BE LESS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS BUT MORE USER INTERFACE AND CURRENT INTENTIONS AND EVERYTHING WHICH IS LINKED WITH THIS  </s>
BUT HOW OFTEN THE LOUNGE IS USED UM  </s>
SO YOU CAN SWITCH TO YOUR VIDEO AND THEN THE SAME BUTTONS CONTROL YOUR VIDEO  </s>
YEP THAT'S RIGHT  </s>
AND SO WITH FIRE WIRE WE ARE SURE TO HAVE A UM AN ACQUISITION SYSTEM  </s>
OKAY  </s>
SO WE KEEP THE CURVE  </s>
YEAH  </s>
BUT WHEN YOU USE A <unk> A <unk> REMOTE CONTROL THAT DOESN'T SPORT THESE BUTTONS IT STILL WORKS  </s>
SO <unk> <unk> TEXTURES YEAH  </s>
OKAY  </s>
I MEAN THE STREAM  </s>
OUR REMOTE WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE IT P. D. A.  </s>

EIGHTY PER CENT SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR A FANCIER LOOKING REMOTE  </s>
YEAH I YEAH ALL THESE STANDARDS ARE REALLY OKAY  </s>
YEAH  </s>
SO WE SHOULD PUT UH ZAP BUTTONS ON IT  </s>
SO YOU MAKE A SCHEMATIC OF THE WAY THAT THE THE ENERGY IS CONVERTED  </s>
WELL I I DID SINGLE CURVE TO WELL YOU SAID <unk> DOUBLE CURVED UH HE BECAUSE UH I THOUGHT IT'S A <unk> A BIT CHEAPER ALREADY  </s>

WELL  </s>
SO I THINK WE'VE DONE A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT THAT JUST WITH LIGHTING AND THE BUTTONS AND THE  </s>
AND FROM THERE IT SIGNALS A MORSE CODE LIKE SIGNAL TO THE TO THE <unk> TO THE BULB IN UH IN THE TELEVISION SET  </s>
OH RIGHT  </s>

RIGHT  </s>
YEAH  </s>
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY SEE PEOPLE SHAKING THEIR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE USING IT  </s>
OOH THAT'D BE GOOD  </s>
YEAH  </s>
UM  </s>
LIKE UH TEN BUTTONS FOR FOR ALL THE FOR ALL THE CHANNELS UM AND HERE ONE FOR FOR  </s>
LITTLE BIT MORE FOR COMFORT YEAH EXTRA FEATURES  </s>
THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH SORT OF TRACK BASED IN THIS WAY  </s>
YEAH YEAH YEAH BUT FURTHERMORE BETTER  </s>
SOME <unk> UH <unk> REPORT  </s>
UH NOT SURE <unk> UH  </s>
MM-HMM  </s>
THE TH NOT TO HAVE NOT TO HAVE IT DONE BUT JUST TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT COULD INTERACT WITH AUTOMATIC DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTATION  </s>
SO THIS IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR OUR EVALUATION ALSO  </s>
THEN YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF SECONDS NO I DON'T THINK SO  </s>
BUT THEN UM OTHER <unk> UM COULD BE JUST UH THERE COULD BE A MENU BUTTON AND YOU COULD CHANGE THINGS ON THE SCREEN THEN  </s>
BUT UH NOT UH THE BUTTONS USED TO SEARCH ON THE THE CHANNELS ON YOUR TELEVISION  </s>
RESEARCH I HAVE HERE IS ON FASHION STYLE OKAY WHICH AS WE'VE AGREED IS A PRIORITY  </s>
OKAY SO YOU ARE THE EXPERT  </s>

OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T WE WILL NOT SELL  </s>
IT'S THAT SAME CHARGER THAT YOU CAN USE FOR THE HAND PHONE BUT UH AGAIN DEPENDS ON THE TYPES  </s>
MAYBE WE CAN  </s>
DEPENDS HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MOVEMENT IT REALLY NEEDS  </s>
AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO IT IS EACH OF US IS GOING TO UM WE'RE GONNA HAVE DISCUSS THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN FIRST  </s>
UM I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE CONVENTION OF  </s>
BUT IF WE'RE AIMING TO TO BUILD THIS THING FOR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY UM IS THAT A LOT OR A LITTLE  </s>
YEAH  </s>
SO IT FOR UH IN PREVIOUS DISCOURSE STUDIES UH ESPECIALLY IN DISCOURSE ANALYSIS EXCHANGE UH IS USED TO DESCRIBE THIS KIND OF UH LOCAL STRUCTURE  </s>
BIG AND CLEAR  </s>
BUT THEN WE CAN ADD THE SPECIAL COLOUR  </s>
SO THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN UM A BANANA SHAPED REMOTE IS ONE THAT YOU SHAKE  </s>
YEAH YEAH  </s>
SO WE SHOULD ALSO BE UH LOOK AT THEIR UH TRENDS  </s>
BUT <unk> 'KAY LOOK WHAT IS THE UH IF YOU MAKE IT DOUBLE CURVED IT COSTS ONE EURO MORE  </s>
TERRIBLE  </s>
THESE ARE NOT OUR TARGET PEOPLE  </s>
UM I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED UM IN YOUR EMAILS  </s>
I THINK THO I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A <unk> THEN YOU'D WANT TO HAVE IT SO THAT IT DOES GO OVER THE BUTTONS  </s>
OKAY  </s>
DO WE INCLUDE IT AND DO WE GIVE IT A PROMINENT UH PROMINENT UH PLACE ON ON ON THE ON WELL HUH  </s>
YEAH  </s>
ALRIGHT  </s>
SO I  </s>
NO NO NO NO NO  </s>
