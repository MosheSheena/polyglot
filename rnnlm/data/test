OR DO WE WANT THEM ALL IN ONE PANE WITH LIKE AN ICON OR A DIFFERENT COLOUR OR SOMETHING TO INDICATE WHAT TYPE OF RESULT THEY ARE </s>
SO THAT WHEN THEY YOU KNOW CLICK ON THAT IT'S GONNA GO TO THE RELEVANT THING </s>
LIKE JUST IF THEY CHECK ALL THREE SAY TOPICS SUMMARIES BLAH BLAH BLAH HAVE THREE DIFFERENT WINDOWS COME UP </s>
OR THREE LIKE SUB SUB PANES SORT OF </s>

SOME ARE QUITE AMUSING ACTUALLY </s>
THE UH THE INFLUENCES OF I LIVED IN GERMANY FOR SIX MONTHS DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAD ANY EFFECT </s>
JUST SPEND TOO MUCH TIME TALKING TO BRITS </s>
THAT WAS BIZARRE THING </s>
WHERE DID THESE PEOPLE COME FROM </s>
SO THEN THE ALL THAT'S CALCULATED AS WELL </s>
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET THE DIALOGUE ACTS </s>
I DON'T THINK THAT'LL BE DIFFICULT </s>
UM </s>
SO THEN DOES THIS HOW DOES IS HOW IS THIS BOX POPULATED </s>
IS IT POPULATED BY THE ONE PRESENT OR THE ONE HIGHLIGHTED </s>
THE ONE PRESENT OKAY </s>
'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT I'M USING THERE IS THERE ARE METHODS THAT SAY UM FOR THE USING FOR OTHER TALKS </s>
SO THAT'S AND IT SAYS LIKE GET GET TALK TIME AND YOU AND Y IT TAKES A NAME </s>
SO THAT W COULD CALL THAT WOULD CALL THAT AND CALL THE MEETINGS METHOD THAT SAID RETURN THAT </s>
AND THAT WOULD POPULATE THAT WHICH SHOULD BE AN EASY THING TO DO </s>
UM AND THE SAME FOR THAT COMES OUT THERE </s>
MEETINGS </s>
YEAH YEAH </s>
YEP </s>
YEAH YEAH THAT WOULD BE EASY AS WELL YEAH </s>
YEAH OKAY </s>
SO I'LL W I'LL JUST LEAVE IN LOTS OF METHODS THAT ST THAT'LL JUST RETURN ONE NUMBER AT A TIME </s>
THAT'LL BE THE EASIEST WAY TO DO YEAH </s>
OKAY YEAH THAT'S FINE </s>
YEAH </s>
GET TALK TIME I THINK IT'S CALLED AT THE MOMENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH </s>
NO IT'S STORED AS AN OBJECT FILE </s>
IT PROCESSES A WHOLE LOT OFF LINE AND STORES IT AS AN OBJECT AND THEN THEY'RE MUCH MUCH SMALLER </s>
THEY'RE ONLY LIKE A ONE UM ONE THOU ONE K. </s>
YEAH IT'S ALL PRE PROCESSED </s>
AND THEN IT'S JUST EACH METHOD OBJECT'S GOT A RETURN BUNCH OF RETURN METHODS </s>
YOU HAVE TO G RE CREATE THE OBJECT </s>
IT'S GOT A LOAD METHOD </s>
SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU CALL A NULL CONSTRUCTOR 'CAUSE IF YOU CALL THE TH PROPER CONSTRUCTOR FOR EACH MEETING </s>
IT GOES OFF AND DOES ALL THE PROCESSING AND STORES OWN OBJECT </s>
AND THEN UM IF YOU CALL A NULL CONSTRUCTOR </s>
THEN YOU PR CALL LOAD AND YOU CAN CALL LOAD AND WHATEVER ONE OR ALL OF THEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT </s>
GO THROUGH A LIST </s>
YEAH </s>
ONE OBJECT FOR EACH MEETING </s>
YEAH </s>
ALTHOUGH YEAH YEAH </s>
ALTHOUGH YOU C </s>
YEAH </s>
IT'S JUST TELL IT TELLS YOU WHO PARTICIPATED </s>
AT THE MOMENT IT TELLS YOU WHO PARTICIPATED AND THE AMOUNT THEY PARTICIPATED IN PERCENTAGES AND IN TIME AS WELL </s>
YEAH YEAH THAT'LL BE PRO THAT'D BE EASY YEAH </s>
YEAH IF THAT WON'T BE TOO DIFFICULT </s>
BUT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD CAUSE A PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING THAT WASN'T ANNOTATED FOR TOPICS </s>
OH YEAH </s>
NO TOPIC SPECIFIED YEAH HAVE A DEFAULT YEAH </s>
THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE SOME DEFAULT ACTUALLY </s>
THE UM A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET THEIR OWN CH AND OTHER STUFF </s>
BUT </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
RIGHT </s>
Y OH YEAH THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM </s>
AND THEN YOU COULD DO A SEARCH OVER THE MEETINGS OVER THE OBJECTS </s>
'CAUSE THAT'S THE THING THESE THESE ARE SO SMALL </s>
THEY CAN LOAD EACH O ALL OF THE WHOLE LOT UP AND DO A SEARCH OF THE WHOLE LOT TO FIND WHO BY WHO AND WHAT PROBLEM OR WHAT TOPICS WERE IN WHAT </s>
SO IT DOESN'T CRASH THE THING </s>
WHAT THE GLOBAL STATISTICS COME STRAIGHT OFF OF THAT DON'T THEY </s>
'CAUSE THEY'RE JUST FOR THE METER MET TH THE </s>
THE SPEAKER CLASS KNOWS ABOUT ALL OF THAT STUFF AND THE MEETING CLASS KNOWS ABOUT THAT STUFF </s>
UM </s>
NO NO BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'LL BE TOO DIFFICULT </s>
WHAT WE WANT YEAH </s>
I THOUGHT THE OTHER STUFF WAS MORE IMPORTANT ANYWAY SO I DID THAT FIRST </s>
MM NO DESIGN THE GUI FIRST AND UH 'CAUSE IT IT W THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU CHANGE THE CLASSES </s>
IT THE OBJECT'S SERIAL NUMBERS CHANGE AND YOU CAN'T RE LOAD THE OBJECT SO ALL THE PROCESSING HAS TO BE DONE OVER AGAIN </s>
AND I HAVEN'T QUITE FINISHED IT </s>
SO </s>
IT WOULD BECOME OUT OF SYNCH AND GET A BIT FUNNY </s>
IF I GAVE YOU ONE IF I GAVE YOU IT ONE AND YOU WORKED ON IT </s>
AND THEN I CHANGED IT AND RUN THE THING AGAIN YOU WOULDN'T EVER BE ABLE TO LOAD THE OBJECTS BACK UP </s>
AND YOU'D HAVE TO AND THEN YOU'D HAVE A V MULTIPLE COPIES OF OBJECTS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND IT'D GET SILLY I THINK </s>
BUT IF YOU CAN IF YOU WANNA MAKE THE PICTURE C YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT ANYTHING I'M PRESUMING </s>
JU JUST THE THAT YEAH </s>
THE TEXT BOX </s>
'CAUSE THAT DOESN'T OKAY </s>
ALRIGHT </s>
WELL IT WON'T TAKE VERY LONG TO GET IT ALL FINISHED </s>
BUT I THINK I'LL NEED TO HAVE DONE ALL OF THIS STUFF TOO FIRST </s>
'CAUSE OTHERWISE THE OBJECTS WON'T BE THE SAME </s>
NO IT'S ON MY HOME DIRECTORY </s>
YEAH </s>
NO I HAVEN'T GLOBAL YET </s>
WHEN IT'S FINISHED UP GLOBAL OTHERWISE IT WOULD GET CONFUSING </s>
THAT WAY IT DOESN'T CRASH IF YOU TRY AND LOAD ALL TEN IN ONE IT CRASHES DOESN'T IT </s>
IT IT'S A BIT DUMB IF YOU CAN FOOL IT IF YOU C IF YOU C LOAD UP TEN DIFFERENT SI ENGINES SIMULTANEOUSLY </s>
IT CAN DO THAT FINE </s>
BUT IT CAN'T DO THEM IT CAN'T DO THEM IF IT THINKS ONE </s>
'CAUSE THEN IT'S ABOUT THE AMOUNT THAT EACH IF YOU YOU HAVE TO KINDA CALL A NEW CLASS AND THEN IT WILL DO IT FINE </s>
BUT IF YOU DON'T THEN IT WON'T L YEAH IT SAYS OKAY OH YEAH I'VE GOT ALL THIS SPACE YOU CAN USE SOME </s>
OTHERWISE IT GOES OH NO </s>
IT TALKS TO ME YEAH </s>
SAY NICE MACHINE IT GOES </s>
OH THEY'RE DONE ARE THEY </s>
OKAY COOL </s>
THEY POP UP </s>
UH YEAH </s>
WELCOME TO THE L. S. N. L. S. D. BROWSER </s>

LOAD ME A MEETING LOAD ME A SEARCH LOAD ME SOMETHING ELSE </s>
WHISTLE A TUNE </s>
YEAH </s>
HMM </s>
I THAT'S CHEAPER THAN X. T. SEARCH </s>
IT WOULD NEED YOU TO HAVE A MEETING LOADED BEFORE IT WILL START DOING ANY SEARCHING AT ALL DOESN'T IT </s>
YOU CAN'T THE THE ONLY THING YOU CAN SEARCH IS A NITE OBJECT MODEL AND THE ONLY TIME YOU GET ONE OF THOSE IF YOU'VE LOADED AN OBSERVATION </s>
YEAH </s>
WHICH WE BUT DOESN'T THAT WAY C YOU COU YOU COULD USE THE INVERTED FILE SEARCH TO RETURN A LIST OF OF MEETINGS AND THEN USE ONE OF THOSE TO LOAD A SEARCH </s>
BUT YOU WON'T </s>
IT HAS TO BE AN OBSERVATION AND EVEN IF YOU GO AND SE YOU CAN GO AND SEARCH THE WHOLE CORPUS FROM THAT </s>
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT HAS TO START WITH SOMETHING FOR SOME BIZARRE REASON </s>
THE ENGINE THERE'S ONLY ONE THERE'S ONLY ONE SEARCH METHOD TO THE SEARCH ENGINE </s>
UH THE ENGINE CLASS ONLY HAS ONE SEARCH METHOD </s>
YEAH YEAH GLOBALLY YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEP </s>
IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO LOAD UP ANYWAY </s>
YOU CAN LOAD A DUMB ONE UP THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY </s>
EXACTLY YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
BUT ONLY GIVES ONE AT A TIME ANYWAY DOESN'T IT </s>
'CAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'LL CRASH THE THING </s>
YEAH </s>
IT'S NOT TOO SLOW THOUGH THAT THING </s>
IT SHOULDN'T IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TOO BAD ON THAT </s>
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE A MUCH OF A PROBLEM </s>
YEAH YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH YEAH </s>
MA MAKE IT STRINGS FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND THEN ONLY RETURN THE THINGS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY NEEDS TO HAS TO SEARCH </s>
WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE LOADED </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
DID WE THINK ABOUT UM </s>
BETTER NAMES FOR THE MEETINGS </s>
OH DO THEY DO THEY RE TRANSLATE THEM </s>
DO THEY </s>
OKAY WELL THAT'S ALRIGHT THEN </s>
WE'LL JUST USE THAT THEN </s>
WELL THAT'S WHAT'S THE THAT'S THE WORKING GROUP IS IT </s>
OKAY </s>
I WANNA SEE THE MEETINGS ABOUT EVEN BETTER UNDERSTANDING </s>
OKAY THAT'S COOL THAT'S GOOD </s>
SO WHO WOULD THE THE UM I. D. F. S </s>
I MEAN THE D. F. S </s>
THE DOCUMENT FREQUENCIES FOR EACH WORD IN THE CORPUS </s>
YEAH TO DO UM WHAT STEVE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU DO </s>
TO DO THE TOPIC LABELLING </s>
IF SOMEBODY'S DONE THE KEYWORDS OR THE THE G I. D. F. S OR THE D. F. S ALREADY WOULD </s>
CAN'T YOU DO ANY BETTER FOR OUR SEARCH WITHOUT THE T. F. I. D. F. </s>
I THINK YOU NEED TO </s>
IT'S THE AMOUNT THAT THEY OCCUR OVER DOCUMENTS </s>
BASICALLY THE AMOUNT THEY D. F. IS THE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY IS THE AMOUNT THAT EACH WORD OCCURS UM NO WHAT IS IT </s>
TERM FREQUENCY IS THE AMOUNT THAT THAT IT OCCURS IN EA ONE OF THEM IS THE AMOUNT IT OCCURS IN EACH DOCUMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE AMOUNT IT G OCCURS GENERALLY </s>
SO IF YOU SO THE MORE IT OCCURS IN SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS COMPARED COMPARED TO ITS GENERAL SCORE THE BET MORE INFORMATIVE IT IS ABOUT A CERTAIN </s>
THE CORPUS THE CORPUS STILL DATA </s>
YEAH </s>
NO </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
BUT PLUS A STOP LIST SO YOU REMOVE STUFF THAT DOESN'T TA IT LIKE YEAH AND THEN THE WHICH IS GONNA A A PROB BASICALLY EQUAL SCORE </s>
OR A MASSIVE </s>
BUNCH OF KEY WORDS </s>
THAT'D PROBABLY BE EASIEST THING </s>
KEY WORDS </s>
YEAH KEY WORDS THREE F THREE FIVE WORDS </s>
IN BOTH DOCUMENTS </s>
YEAH TERM FREQUENCY INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY </s>
I DID DO IT ONCE I DO HAVE A JAVA CLASS THAT DOES IT FOR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'LL WORK WITH THIS </s>
BUT </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
ALSO KEY WORDS GIVES YOU A A WHOLE NEW TYPE OF SEARCH </s>
YOU DO KEYWORD SEARCH </s>
BUT YOU COULD DO KEY WORD SEARCH COULD BE TOPIC SEARCH CAN THEY CAN BE THE SAME THING </s>
INSTEAD UH IT WOULD JUST SEARCH FOR KEY WORDS WHEN IT WHEN THEY YOU TELL HIM THAT WITH TOPICS BUT ACTUALLY GET SEARCHING WITH KEY WORDS </s>
FOR EACH DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN </s>
BUT I SUPPOSE EVEN CALCULATING THE THE W THE THE WHAT'S ITS FACES THEMSELVES WOULD BE TOO MUCH TOO LONG </s>
THE EASY BIT IS IT'S PROBABLY THE EASIEST TO CALCULATE THEM BASED UPON IN THEIR WHOLE OCCURRENCES IN I IN THE CORPUS THAN IT IS TO CALCULATE THEM PER TOPIC </s>
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO INTEGRATE AS MUCH INFORMATION </s>
NO YOU CAN DO YOU CAN DO SEARCH WITHOUT T. F. I. D. F. YOU JUST CAN'T RANK THE SEARCH </s>
YEAH </s>
NO NO NO BUT THAT'S WHAT ISN'T THAT WHAT THE IDEA WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RANK THESE RANK THE RESULTS SO THAT </s>
YEAH BUT THAT WON'T SLOW IT DOWN </s>
RANKING IT WON'T SLOW IT DOWN </s>
YEAH </s>
IT STILL USES AN INVERTED FILE BUT IT RANKS THE RESULTS BY THE AMOUNT BY THE HIGHER YEAH </s>
I THOUGHT THAT WAS PART OF IT BUT YEAH OKAY IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S NOT </s>
UM </s>
NO WE DID YEAH </s>
BUT YEAH I GUESS UH IF YOU DO IF IF THAT'S NOT PART OF IT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT IT DOESN'T </s>
'CAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA DO THIS IF I'VE GOT TIME ANYWAY </s>
SO </s>
YEAH </s>
WELL IT'D JUST GIVE YOU A RANK </s>
IT WOULD THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT WAS TO IF YOU SAY THIS IS YOUR TOP ONE THIS IS YOUR BOTTOM </s>
YEAH </s>
BUT SAY BUT IT'S HOW HOW INFORMATIVE </s>
THAT T. F. I. D. F. IS AN INFORMATIVE SCORE ISN'T IT </s>
SO </s>
DEPENDS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR COMPOUND NOUNS </s>
LIKE WHAT </s>
AS A COMPOUND NOUN </s>
UH SUNNY DAY YEAH </s>
AND LIKE AN ADJECTIVE YEAH </s>
UM </s>
IN ITS MOST SIMPLE FORM IT WOULD DO A SEPARATE RANK FOR EACH ONE EACH TERM </s>
YOU COULD MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED AND MAKE IT DO FOR TH FOR THE YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YOU CAN JUST ADD 'EM UP OR YOU CAN </s>
YEAH YEAH </s>
YEAH YOU DON'T WANNA START LOOKING FOR BO </s>
YEAH </s>
UM </s>
I GUESS YOU JUST DO A SUM OF THE UM OF THE THE INDIVIDUAL T. F. I. D. F. FOR EACH TERM RETURNED </s>
AND THAT GENERALLY WILL BE A BIT CRUDE BUT IT WILL GIVE YOU A D SCORE </s>
AND THE HIGHER THE MORE UH MORE INFORMATIVE EACH TERM IS FOR EACH THING WOULD GIVE YOU A </s>
A THING </s>
IT'S PRETTY CRUDE ANYWAY BUT IT'S JUST LOOKING FOR UM </s>
IF IT'S ALL IT'S GONNA DO IS LOOK FOR SIX SEPARATE C OH 'CAUSE THEN IT'S GONNA GO INTO THE N. X. T. SEARCH AND RETURN THAT ISN'T IT </s>
SO MM YEAH </s>
YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE </s>
SO YEAH THAT'S LESS CRUDE ISN'T IT </s>
BUT UM </s>
GROUPS OF TERMS </s>
YEAH WITHOUT DOING ANY LIKE UM WORD PAIRS WHICH IS JUST OMISSION </s>
YEAH I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS </s>
THAT'S HOW I REMEM YEAH </s>
BUT THEN THE IDEA IS THAT GIVES YOU AN INFORMATIVE SCORE </s>
HOW YOU COMBINE THAT IS IS UP TO YOU </s>
I GUESS IT THERE'S LOTS IN THE LITERATURE </s>
I IF S IF YOU WERE IS THERE'S A LO WHOLE LOAD ABOUT IT IN MANNING AND SCHUTZ </s>
SO THEY'VE GOT A WHOLE CHUNK ABOUT IT'S SO JUST I. R. ISN'T THIS </s>

OR THE OTHER THING TO DO IS JUST HAVE SEARCH AS THE DEFAULT </s>
JUST IT OPENS AND THE SEARCH WINDOW OPENS </s>
AND THAT'S THE INTERFACE AND YOU JUST GO FROM THERE </s>
AND THEN THAT BRINGS UP THE BROWSER AFTER YOU F SEARCHED FOR SOMETHING </s>
OR OR THE SEARCH BUT THE SEARCH WINDOW COULD HAVE ON IT SOMETHING THAT SAID JUST HAS A DROP DOWN MENU THAT SAYS JUST AND A GO BUTTON THAT SAID TAKE ME TO THIS </s>
AND SO THE F SO THE IN YEAH </s>
SO THE F ONLY THING THAT COMES UP WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED IS A UM WHEN YOU START IT'S JUST ONE WINDOW LIKE THAT AND IT'S GOT ALL THE SEARCH STUFF LIKE DOWN THERE </s>

MM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
IN OUR FIRST YEAR </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YOU'VE GOT MARKET RANGE INTERNATIONAL AND YOU DID SAY EARLIER IT'S GOT TO BE A UM ACCESSIBLE AND USABLE BY SORT OF ALL AGE GROUPS JUST T WE'RE NOT FOCUSING ON BUSINESS MARKET </s>
ANY PARTICULAR THING IT'S EVERYONE USER FRIENDLY TO EVERYONE </s>
OKAY </s>
BIG TARGET GROUP </s>
NO </s>
MM </s>
ALRIGHT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
RIGHT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MY EXPERIENCE HAS ONLY BEEN BEING GIVEN THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH THE OBJECT I BUY </s>
NOT DOING ANY TAMPERING WITH IT AND PROGRAMMING USING IT TO PROGRAMME T. V. AND UH UH VIDEOS AND THINGS </s>
BUT BASICALLY ON OFF VOLUME UP AND DOWN CHANNEL ONE TWO TH THAT BASIC FUNCTIONS </s>
I DON'T THINK I COULD GO ANY FURTHER WITH IT THAN THAT SO I SUPPOSE IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING USABLE BY SOMEONE LIKE ME AS WELL </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM </s>
MM </s>
AND SYMBOLS THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND SYMBOLS YOU'RE MEANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T </s>
OH YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
ACTUALLY THAT JUST RAISES A POINT I WONDER WHAT OUR DESIGN PEOPLE THINK </s>
BUT YOU KNOW ON A MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN PRESS A KEY AND IT GIVES YOU A MENU </s>
IT'S GOT A MENU DISPLAY I WONDER IF INCORPORATING THAT INTO THE DESIGN OF A REMOTE CONTROL MIGHT BE USEFUL SO YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE L. C. D. DISPLAY </s>
WITH MENUS YEAH YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
CAN HE PROGRAMME HIS REMOTE CONTROL OR IS IT BASIC WITH THAT TOO </s>
RIGHT </s>
RIGHT </s>
SO THAT'S A PROBLEM REGARDLESS OF OF ANY DESIGN MODIFICATIONS YOU YOU COME UP WITH </s>
THAT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM ANYWAY WITH THE OLDER GENERATION PERHAPS AND THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE HOW WE TACKLE THAT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
RIGHT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THAT FOR THE OLDER GENERATION YOU COULD HAVE LIKE AN EXTRA BUTTON THAT YOU PRESS FOR LARGE PRINT LIKE YOU DO IN LARGE PRINT BOOKS </s>
OBVIOUSLY IT DISPLAYS LESS ON THE SCREEN IT DISPLAYS LESS ON THE SCREEN BUT AS LONG AS THEY CAN READ IT THAT'S THE MAIN THING </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM </s>
THE OTHER THING IS JUST CH CHUCKING INTO MOBILE PHONE F DESIGN FEATURES AGAIN </s>
IT COULD HAVE A FLIP TOP REMOTE CONTROL SO THAT WHEN YOU FLIP OVER THE TOP </s>
YOUR SCREEN IS YOU CAN HAVE A BIGGER SCREEN IN THE THE FLIP OVER </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH LIKE SMALLER </s>
AND THERE'S NO REASON WE NEED TO MAKE IT LOOK AS FASHIONABLE AND STYLISH AS A MOBILE PHONE IT CAN STILL BE LIGHTWEIGHT PLASTIC YOU KNOW </s>
SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY MOULDED AND PRODUCED </s>
SORRY I'M TREADING ON YOUR TERRITORY GUYS </s>
AH RIGHT </s>
OKAY </s>
SURE B Y YEAH </s>
BUT YEAH I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT </s>
YOU KNOW TH THAT WAS MY MAIN POINT WE DON'T HAVE TO USE METAL </s>

ACTUALLY MM SOME OF MY POINTS MIGHT OVERLAP WITH WHAT WILLIAM'S JUST MENTION BUT BASICALLY MY METHOD WAS LIKE UH WHATEVER BRAINSTORMING WE DID IN THE LAST MEETING </s>
JUST A COUPLE OF VALUABLE POINTS AND STARTED DEVELOPING ON THAT AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME MISSING LOOPS IN THIS THING WHICH I THINK WE'LL UH TAKE A FEEDBACK FROM THE MARKETING BECAUSE </s>
UM I HAVEN'T HAD SOME MARKETING DATA AND BASICALLY EVERY PRODUCT IS MARKETABLE </s>
SO PURPOSE AS WILLIAM ALREADY SAID I WOULD PUT IT TO SIMPLIFY THE INTERACTION WITH T. V. TO MAKE MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE </s>
AND TO SUMMARISE I I WOULD SAY IT'S IT SHOULD BE USER FRIENDLY BY BEING EASY TO USE </s>
RATHER THAN HAVING A LOT OF COMPLEX BUTTON BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE AN ENGINEERING MAYBE HAVING HUNDRED BUTTONS AND MAYBE HAVING UH A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH HAS THE MAIN FEATURES </s>
LIKE VOLUME CONTROL OR CHANNEL CH CHANGING THE CHANNEL OR WHATEVER </s>
BUT WE ARE TO TO MAKE IT UNIQUE SO THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BUY IT WILL THIS TWO FEATURES TOGETHER </s>
SO WHAT THE CONCEPT IS TO HAVE A FLIP TOP MODEL </s>
THE MAIN FUNCTIONS SUCH AS WHICH ARE LIKE OFTEN USED WILL BE ON THE TOP AND THE COMPLEX FUNCTIONS WHICH SAY YOU YOU CAN SAY LIKE THE Y YOUNG GENERATION OR TRENDY GENERATION WANT TO PR SAY PROGRAMME THEIR FAVOURITE CHANNELS OR WHATEVER </s>
CAN BE PUT IN THE MIDDLE PART OF THE F FLIP TOP </s>
SO IT'S LIKE IT COULD BE ACCESSED BY A WIDE RA RANGE OF UH AUDIENCE AND WE CAN PUNCH IN NEW F FEATURES SUCH AS UH ADDED FEATURES SUCH AS SHOCK PROOF BODY AND MAYBE A DESIGN TO APPEAL TO A LOT OF PEOPLE </s>
FINDINGS MOST PEOPLE PREFER US USER FRIENDLY RATHER THAN COMPLEX REMOTE CONTROLS BECAUSE THERE ARE TIMES LIKE UH PEOPLE HAVE USED A REMOTE CONTROL FOR SAY A YEAR OR SOMETHING AND THEY THEY ARE NOT USED MAYBE THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS SO IT'S NOT OF NO USE OF PUNCHING IN THE UH TRYING TO PUT IN THOSE THINGS IN ON THE TOP OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND TRY TO CONFUSE THE USER </s>
AS WE SAW WE WE HAVE TO MAKE A PROFIT ALSO SO WE WE CAN MAYBE GO FOR AN ECONOMIES OF A HIGHER PRODUCTION MM BY FIFTY MILLION WE SAID </s>
YEAH WITH THAT I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE ALSO SO WE CAN GIVE IN ADD IN MORE FEATURES AND MAKE IT LESS COSTLY </s>
UM </s>
THAT'S SO THIS IS IF YOU ASK ME PERSONALLY I WOULD MAKE UH </s>
FLIP TOP WITH A TRENDY UH UH DESIGN AND S MAYBE WE WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALSO LIKE THE BUTTONS WHE WHETHER THEY ARE LIKE SOFT OR LITTLE HARD BECAUSE THEY ARE TIMES WHEN THE BUTTONS TEND TO BE A BIT HARD AFTER UH CONTINUOUS USE USAGE AND ALL THAT </s>
SO IN OVERALL A SIMPLE AND UH </s>
USER FRIENDLY DESIGN </s>
UH ANY COMMENTS LIKE IF YOU WANT </s>
OKAY </s>
I THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO </s>
YOU CAN'T </s>
IT'LL HAVE TO THIS CAN'T BE PULLED </s>
YOU'LL HAVE TO PUSH IT A BIT MORE </s>

YEAH THIS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH </s>
OKAY </s>
YEAH I THINK YOU CAN PULL IT OUT NOW </s>
YEAH </s>
'KAY </s>
THAT'S FINE </s>
OKAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>

TEN PERC </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
PENS </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
SO ARE WE TALKING OF A SINGLE MODEL OR MAYBE FIVE SIX DESIGNS </s>
SURE </s>
ALRIGHT </s>
RIGHT </s>
THE FEATURES COULD BE SAME AND THE BODY COULD LOOK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT </s>
SO </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH UH MAYBE TO AS UH IT IT WAS INDICATED THAT UH UH RISK UH OF UH REPEATED USE </s>
THE INJURIES MAYBE A TOUCH SCREEN COULD BE A BETTER OPTION FOR THAT </s>
SO A BIGGER B OKAY SO Y YOU'RE DIVIDING DESIGNS BASED ON NOT ONLY SEGMENT AGE GROUPS </s>
YOU'RE DESI UH DIVIDING IT ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRIES ALSO THE MARKET </s>
MAYBE FOR U. S. AND ALL YOU CAN HAVE A SLIGHTLY BIGGER REMOTE CONTROL AND MAYBE IN JAPAN AND ALL YOU NEED TO HAVE A SMALL YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
WE COULD FOCUS ON THE BIGGEST MARKET </s>
IF SAY PEOPLE BETWEEN AGE GROUP OF TWENTY TO THIRTY FIVE ARE THE BIGGEST MARKET </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
RIGHT </s>
I THINK IT WILL BE TOO MUCH OF AN EFFORT FOR A PERSON TO FOR A PHONE MAYBE HE MIGHT WALK DOWN THE STREET </s>
BUT FOR A REMOTE HE WILL JUST REFER TO THE MANUAL AND ALL THAT </s>
SIMPLE </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
SO ARE WE TALKING OF A CONCEPT OF A RECHARGEABLE SOMETHING ON THE REMOTE </s>
MM-HMM </s>
RIGHT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
WHAT I WAS THINKING OF A DESIGN WHICH NOKIA H UH CAME UP WITH ALMOST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS BACK </s>
BASICALLY WE HAVE A FLAT ONE IT IT LOOKS LIKE A BOX LIKE A CHOCOLATE </s>
THAT'S VERY STRENUOUS BECAUSE YOUR THUMB IS SLIGHTLY UP SO THEY CAME UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS CURLED UP SO HERE </s>
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOU DON'T BEND YOUR THUMB TOO MUCH </s>
SO IT'S LIKE UH YOU CAN SAY A BANANA SHAPE KIND OF THING CURLED UP LIKE A BOAT </s>
G UH SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS YOUR THUMB TOO DOWN LIKE </s>
SO IT'S ALREADY CURLED UP SO YOUR THUMB DOESN'T Y YEAH SO WE CAN HAVE A S LIKE YOU KNOW MOULDED ACCORDING TO YOUR </s>
THE WAY YOU H HOLD OF IT'S KIND OF SEMI CIRCULAR IN THE BOTTOM SOMETHING LIKE THAT </s>
I WOULDN'T SAY EXACTLY SEMI CIRCULAR BUT YEAH SMOOTH </s>
CURRENT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
WE COULD LOOK IN AT THAT BUT </s>
MM </s>
WHAT WE WERE TALKING IS TO MAKE IT MORE </s>
RATHER THAN LIKE SEA SHELLS LOGO COULD BECOME AS YOU COULD PUT A LOGO IN THE CORNER OF UH THE MODEL </s>
RATHER THAN YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE IT LIKE A SEA SHELL OR WHATEVER YOU WERE TA TELLING LIKE </s>
A SEA SHELL </s>
YEAH WE COULD LOOK IN AT THAT </s>
YEAH MAYBE WE COULD COME AT SOME SAY FIVE </s>
SIX DES DESIGNS AND THEN CHOOSE WHICH ARE WHICHEVER APPEALS THE MOST LIKE THAT COULD BE THE MOST COMMON DESIGN </s>
BUT WE CAN LIKE THINK OF FIVE SIX DESIGNS </s>
MM-HMM </s>

UM RIGHT OUR AGENDA FOR TODAY DO YOU WANT US TO GIVE YOU A SECOND </s>
OKAY UM </s>
I'LL GO OVER WHAT WE DECIDED LAST MEETING </s>
UM </s>
WE DECIDED UPON A UNIVERSAL CONTROL ONE HANDSET FOR ALL T. V. VIDEO </s>
EQUIPMENT </s>
UM THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE PRODUCT WAS ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMERS WIDE AGE RANGE NOT LIMITING ANYONE </s>
WE DECIDED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO REFLECT THE COMPANY'S IMAGE IN OUR PRODUCT WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF S THING </s>
UM OUR BUDGET WOULD HAVE TO AFFECT UM TRY NOT TO REFLECT OUR BUDGET UM THAT WE MIGHT </s>
HAVE A BIT OF OH OH YOU CAN SEE IT OKAY </s>
UM DISSONANCE BETWEEN WHAT OUR BUDGET WAS AND WHAT WE WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE </s>
UM </s>
WANT IT TO LOOK UNCLUTTERED UNDAUNTING TO THE CUSTOMER </s>
WE DISCUSSED A FLIP OPEN DESIGN UM REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE CONTROL AND AN ELECTRONIC PANEL UM FOR FURTHER FEATURES LIKE PROGRAMMING THINGS LIKE THAT </s>
OKAY </s>
UM THREE PRESENTATIONS I'VE GOT WRITTEN HERE SO </s>
SHALL WE HEAR FROM MARKETING FIRST </s>
NO THAT'S FINE THAT'S FINE </s>
UNPLUG ME </s>
UM F. N. </s>
FUNCTION F. EIGHT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
THEY ARE </s>
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH </s>
UM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONTINUE ON FROM THAT </s>
OR MAYBE MOVE THE LAPTOP OVER </s>
F. FUNCTION </s>
OH THERE </s>
'KAY </s>
UM I THINK WE'LL CHAT ABOUT IT AT THE END </s>
OKAY SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO WRITE SOMETHING DOWN THAT THEY WANT TO BRING UP AT THE END UM </s>
OOH IT'S VIBRATING THAT'S STRANGE </s>
OH GOD </s>
RIGHT OKAY </s>
WE JUST DO THE BEST WE CAN </s>
YEAH YOU MIGHT </s>
AH </s>
LOOK AT THAT </s>
OKAY </s>
YEAH </s>
RIGHT UM </s>
WE HAVE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS UM </s>
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE USING TELETEXT UM APPARENTLY THE CONSUMERS CONSIDER IT OUTDATED WITH THE INTERNET NOW </s>
UM </s>
OUR CONTROL IS ONLY GOING TO BE FOR T. V. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A COMBINED CONTROL </s>
WHICH LIMITS YOU KNOW ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IT LIMITS THE COST FOR US BUT IT ALSO MAKES IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND FOR THE CONSUMER </s>
IT SAYS FOR T. V. ONLY SO LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST YEAH I THINK MAYBE SKY THINGS LIKE THAT MIGHT BE INCORPORATED INTO IT BUT </s>
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK </s>
IT JUST SAID FOR T. V. ONLY </s>
BUT I MEAN GENERAL T. V. CONTROLS DO DO VIDEO AS WELL </s>
I MEAN YOU BU WELL SOM YOU GET COM YOU GET COMBINED T. V. AND VIDEOS DON'T YOU </s>
MM </s>
I THINK WE ASSUME THAT IT'S STILL GOT PLAY AND STOP FUNCTIONS AND PROGRAMMING </s>
MM </s>
HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH BU </s>
WE DO HAVE A BUDGET LIMITATION THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL OURSELVES </s>
SO I THINK WHEN WE CAN TAKE A CHEAPER OPTION WHICH STILL DOES THE SAME KINDA THING UM BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING I IT NEEDS TO BE THE THING THAT YOU </s>
USE TO FIND IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T LOSE YOU WERE SAYING WHISTLING </s>
MAYBE ON THE T. V. YOU COULD PUT LIKE A PACK ON THE T. V. OR SOMETHING SO YOU CAN'T SEE THE REMOTE </s>
YOU GO AND PRESS THE BUTTON ON TOP OF THE T. V. AND IT BEEPS AND YOU'RE LIKE OH OKAY IT'S OVER THERE </s>
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THAT'S THAT SOUNDS A LOT CHEAPER TO ME </s>
UM THE THIRD THING WAS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE CORPORATE IMAGE IS VERY MUCH INCORPORATED INTO THE HANDSET </s>
UM SO WE WANT LOGO WE WANT UM </s>
FASHIONABLE TRENDY I MEAN WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE MARKETING </s>
UM PEOPLE PAYING MORE FOR IT TO LOOK GOOD </s>
UM WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT AS WELL </s>
YEAH </s>
MM </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
WHAT ABOUT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE BUTTONS UM THE CONTROLS THAT ARE COMING OUT NOW HAVE KIND OF BIG </s>
RUBBER BUTTONS NOT TINY LITTLE ONE BIG RUBBER BUTTONS BUT WHAT ABOUT I MEAN 'CAUSE WE GOT TO MAKE IT ORIGINAL </s>
WHAT ABOUT </s>
UM YOU KNOW WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN COMPUTERS </s>
YEAH </s>
UM SO YOU IT'S LIKE A LITTLE PANEL THAT YOU TOUCH RATHER THAN A BUTTON WHICH SHOULDN'T WEAR OUT AS MUCH EITHER NOT SURE ABOUT THE </s>
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS IT YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT YOUR THUMB ONTO IT </s>
UM THINK THAT MIGHT APPEAL I'M THINKING KIND OF JAPAN I'M THINKING UH YOUNG UM OFFICE PEOPLE TRENDY KIND OF A THING </s>
UM BUT QUITE UM </s>
EASILY LABELLED SO THAT ANYONE CAN OH YEAH THAT'S OBVIOUS WHAT THAT'S FOR AND IT'S NOT DAUNTING TO MAYBE THE OLDER GENERATIONS UM </s>
WERE TOO BIG </s>
MM </s>
I THINK WE HAVE TO DESIGN ONE PRODUCT AND THEN THE COMPANY CAN TAKE IT WHEREVER THEY WANT TO UH IN THE SENSE THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT SMALLER </s>
OR THEY CAN MAKE IT BIGGER OR THEY CAN CHANGE THE FEATURES SLIGHTLY UM </s>
IT'S GONNA BE THE SAME SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON JUST ONE THING NOT GET BOGGED DOWN IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT UM POSSIBILITIES UM </s>
OR A SPEECH RECOGNITION WHICH IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU KIND OF AVOID </s>
THAT KIND OF ISSUE </s>
WE ARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UM </s>
THE TYPE OF COMPANY THAT WE'RE WORKING FOR AS WELL </s>
THAT THEY WANT UM IT TO BE FASHIONABLE THEY WANT IT TO BE TRENDY AND YOU WOULDN'T AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME ASSOCIATE THAT WITH THE OLDER GENERATIONS </s>
NOW WITH THE BABY BOOMERS THE OLDER GENERATIONS ARE ACTUALLY LARGER THEY HAVE A GREATER POPULATION THAN US YOUNG PEOPLE </s>
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE FOCUSING ON THAT I THINK WE ARE FOCUSING ON A SORT OF MID RANGE UM </s>
BUSINESS KIND OF CLASS TYPE PEOPLE </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY SO THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS </s>
UM WE'VE GOT THE T. V. WE'VE GOT THE VIDEO NOW THERE'S UM </s>
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CALLED THE LITTLE CODE AT THE END OF PROGRAMME DETAILS YES </s>
WE COULD USE THAT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PROGRAMMING IN TIMES THINGS LIKE THAT IS THAT I ALWAYS FOUND THAT REALLY EASY WHEN I DISCOVERED IT UM </s>
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT YOUR GENERAL RECORD ANYWAY SO IF YOU THERE'S A PROGRAMME ON YOU WANT TO PUT RECORD ON </s>
THAT'S FINE BUT IF YOU DO WANT TO TAPE SOMETHING IN TWO DAYS TIME AND YOU'RE NOT SURE IF YOU'RE GOING TO </s>
YOU PUT THE NUMBER IN AND IT'S JUST A NUMBER IT'S NOT A DATE IT'S NOT A TIME </s>
IT'S NOT A CHANNEL IT'S NOT WHEN IT FINISHES IT'S NOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT'S JUST A NUMBER </s>
NO </s>
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE NUMBERS FOR TYPING IN ANYWAY </s>
IT IS AFTER UM IF YOU LOOK IN THE NEWSPAPER T. V. GUIDE OR ANY T. V. GUIDE THERE'S A FIVE </s>
SIX DIGIT NUMBER AFTERWARDS AND THAT'S THE NUMBER YOU PUT IN AND IT'S RECORDED THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ON ON TUESDAYS AT TEN O'CLOCK ON THE SEVENTEENTH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DATES AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TIMES </s>
UM AND IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE A LONG TIME </s>
NO IT'S NOT UM BUT I THINK IF AWARENESS WAS KIND OF BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT ABOUT THAT </s>
MM </s>
OKAY SO </s>
MM-HMM </s>
THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT IN THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE SITTING THERE YOU'RE PRESSING THIS BUTTON AND YOUR T. V. 'S NOT DOING IT </s>
TAKING YOUR T. V. AND YOUR CONTROL AND SAYING LOOK THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING IT'S NOT WORKING WHAT SHOULD I DO </s>
I THINK SO </s>
UM </s>
INSTRUCTION MANUALS </s>
BUT I MEAN THEY'RE THERE'S CUSTOMER SERVICE </s>
THERE WILL BE A CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER THING THAT YOU CAN PHONE UP AND SPEAK TO AND THAT WAY THERE'S NO CALL OUT CHARGE </s>
THERE'S NO EXTRA T THE PERSON HAS TO WALK TO A SHOP ON THE HIGH STREET UM </s>
MM </s>
BUT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON MAKING THE MANUAL AS USER FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE JUST TINY LITTLE WRITING AND LOTS AND LOTS OF PAGES </s>
IT DOES YOU JUST PUT IT IN THE DRAWER UNTIL SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND THEN YOU TRY AND SEARCH THROUGH IT </s>
SO THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING WE THINK ABOUT </s>
UM WHAT OTHER FUNCTIONS </s>
WE NEED I'M NOT SURE IF WE NEED A DESIGN UM DECISION NOW </s>
BUT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT C 'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE DILEMMA BETWEEN OH BATTERIES THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT </s>
MOBILE PHONE BATTERIES WHAT KINDA BATTERY IS THAT </s>
WELL THEY LA THEY THEY LAST QUITE A LONG TIME AND IF YOU HAD UH WHEN YOU TH THE THING THAT YOU GET WITH MOBILE HOUSE PHONES </s>
YOU SIT IT IN ITS CHARGER WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING IT OR T AT NIGHT OR SOMETHING </s>
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 'CAUSE IT NEVER REALLY RUNS OUT 'CAUSE IT LASTS A LONG TIME ONCE IT IS CHARGED </s>
UM SOMETHING LIKE THAT SHOULD REDUCE THE SIZE OF IT </s>
YEAH IT COULD BE ON THAT YEAH OKAY </s>
S </s>
YES </s>
RECHARGEABLE WITH A DOCKING STATION </s>
SO THE RECHARGEABLE WHICH WOULD BE YOUR </s>
FIELD </s>
OKAY </s>
YES WHICH IT IS CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN AS WELL </s>
UM TH THE SHAPE YOU GOT TRENDY </s>
I DON'T WANNA BIG BOX WITH LOTS OF THINGS YOU DON'T WANT A TINY SORT OF LITTLE THING EITHER </s>
BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE GOT THE REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY NO MATTER HOW MANY HOW MUCH YOU TRY AND MAKE IT SIMPLE UM </s>
THEY DO </s>
OKAY SO WE'VE GOT A FLIP SCREEN </s>
UM </s>
OKAY </s>
'CAUSE IT'S KIND OF MOULDED TO YOUR HAND ANYWAY </s>
OKAY </s>
CAN YOU LOOK INTO THE COMPANY LOGO </s>
UM THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY IN VIEW TO TRYING TO INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT </s>
I MEAN </s>
FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS A C. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU COULD HAVE IT IN A VAGUE C. SHAPE THAT OPENS UP KIND OF LIKE A SHELL </s>
OR SOMETHING UM SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES TO BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE IT QUITE </s>
UM OBVIOUSLY INTO THE DESIGN WHILE ALSO MAKING IT QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S THERE </s>
WELL WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW IT'S GONNA LOOK DIFFERENT </s>
OR YOU COULD DO UM DIFFERENT LIKE YOU GET WITH MOBILE PHONES DIFFERENT FASCIAS </s>
YOU COULD HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF CASINGS </s>
SO YOU COULD HAVE LIKE PSYCHEDELIC ONES FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE AND SLEEK ONES AND </s>
YEAH </s>
MM </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
RIGHT I THINK WE HAVE TO ROUND IT UP UM </s>
SURE </s>
THAT WAS UM IN CUTTING DOWN THE NUMBER THAT WAS KINDA SEPARATE THAT WAS CUTTING DOWN THE NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS </s>
MAKING IT SIMPLER SO INSTEAD OF HAVING LOTS OF THINGS YOU PUT IN FOR DATE </s>
IT'S KINDA TAKES THE PLACE OF HAVING A BUTTON TO PRESS FOR THE DATE AND HAVING THE BUTTON TO PRESS FOR THE CHANNEL THINGS LIKE THAT </s>
UM IT COULD BE IT C </s>
IT YES IT COULD BE UH ADV ADVERTISEMENT FEATURE UM RATHER THAN DESIGN FEATURE YOU KNOW DRAWING ATTENTION TO THAT </s>
AND IT ALSO PAID UM LIP SERVICE IN THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL 'CAUSE IT'S VERY SIMPLE SO PUTTING IT DOWN IN WORDS SHOULD BE HELPFUL </s>
YEAH </s>
UM </s>
WE'VE GOT THE BUTTONS BUT I THINK WE'LL WORK THROUGH THAT WITH THE DESIGN OF IT UM </s>
YES </s>
YES </s>
AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT UM THERE BEING AN ALARM OR SOMETHING A BEEPING FOR BEING LOST UM </s>
LEARNING HOW TO USE IT SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE </s>
BUT THERE AREN'T GONNA BE THAT FUNC THAT MANY FUNCTIONS INCORPORATED INTO IT SO IT SHOULD BE FINE AND THE I THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL </s>
I DON'T KNOW IF WE DEAL WITH THAT UM </s>
I THINK </s>
YEP AND DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S OUT THERE </s>
YEP I THINK THAT'S US </s>
I THINK YOU MIGHT GET GUIDANCE BUT UM </s>
I TH </s>
INSTRUCTION MANUALS 'CAUSE THERE TENDS TO BE A </s>
DEMONISED THING U UM THEY'RE EVERYONE'S GOT LIKE A BIG PILE OF THEM BUT NO ONE REALLY USES THEM </s>
UM </s>
YES RIGHT </s>
OKAY </s>
RIGHT OKAY </s>
I THINK YOU CAN EMAIL ME IF THERE'S ANY MORE QUESTIONS </s>
UM AND I'LL BE ABLE TO NOT ANSWER THEM </s>
OKAY YEAH I'LL GO FIRST </s>
CAN I GRAB THE </s>
THANKS </s>
WHAT DO I HAVE TO PRESS </s>
OH F. EIGHT </s>
OH RIGHT YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
MAYBE </s>
YEP THERE WE GO </s>
OKAY THIS IS UH THE WORKING DESIGN PRESENTED BY ME THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER EXTRAORDINAIRE </s>
'KAY THIS IS WHERE I WENT A BIT MAD WITH POWERPOINT SO </s>
WHAT THE FIRST THING QUESTION I ASKED WAS WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DESIGN </s>
WELL A DEVICE WHICH BASICALLY JUST SENDS THE SIGNAL TO THE T. V. TO CHANGE ITS STATE </s>
WHETHER THAT BE THE POWER OR THE CHANNEL UM OR THE VOLUME </s>
EVERYTHING IS JUST UM SOME SORT OF SIGNAL TO CHANGE THE STATE OF THE T. V. OR OTHER APPLIANCE THAT IT'S SENDING THE SIGNAL TO </s>
UM SO I DECIDED I'D HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT TH OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DESIGNED AND TRY AND TAKE SOME INSPIRATION FROM THAT </s>
BUT UH ALTHOUGH WE WILL WANT TO BE TAKING </s>
IDEAS FROM OTHER PEOPLE WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OUR DESIGN STANDS OUT AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WELL IT WASN'T REALLY MY AREA BECAUSE </s>
I'M DEALING WITH THE INSIDE REALLY </s>
SO UM YEAH I RAN OUT OF TIME SO I COULDN'T DO THIS ONE AS FUN AS THE LAST ONE </s>
UM AND UH I FOUND OUT THAT MOST UH CONTROLS USE SOME FORM OF INFRARED TO SEND SIGNALS TO THE T. V. PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF THE COST ISSUE OF UH SOMETHING LIKE UH THE SAME THING THAT COMPUTERS USE </s>
WIRELESS AND YOU DON'T NEED TO SEND VERY MUCH INFORMATION </s>
UM MOST OF THEM ARE POWERED BY SOME FORM OF BATTERY </s>
NOW OUR ONE </s>
I'M I'M NOT SURE WHETHER WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE SIZE ISSUE BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE POWERED BY TRIPLE A. BATTERIES BUT THOSE CAN BE QUITE BULKY SO I D I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE UM SO WE COULD SHRINK DOWN THE SIZE OF THE CONTROL </s>
YEAH SURE </s>
UM NO NO </s>
IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT IF YOU LOOK AT MOST REMOTE CONTROLS THEY'RE QUITE THEY'RE QUITE CHUNKY AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE BATTERIES </s>
THEY HAVE TO BE OBVIOUSLY THIS CERTAIN SIZE TO FIT THOSE BATTERIES IN </s>
YEAH THE THE WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN GET THE SORT OF CIRCULAR ROUND ONES BUT I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT POWER CONSUMPTION AND HOW MUCH YOU NEED TO SEND THE DATA ACROSS </s>
UM AND D WHICH LEADS SORT OF ONTO THE NEXT POINT ABOUT 'EM BEING SMALL AND EASY TO CARRY ROUND </s>
UM NOW THE ONES AT THE MOMENT ARE SMALL BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING IF WE COULD LOOK AT SOMETHING A BIT SMALLER </s>
NOW THE MAIN COMPONENTS I CAME UP WITH UM WERE OBVIOUSLY THE POWER SOURCE FOR THE BATTERIES 'CAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S NOT GONNA WORK </s>
UH AS I SAID ABOUT THE W WHICH BATTERIES WE WERE GONNA CHOOSE </s>
WE CAN UH DISCUSS THAT LATER AND THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED SOMETHING TO DECODE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN FROM FROM THE CONTROLLER AND TO TURN IT INTO AN I UH INFRARED SIGNAL WHICH WE'RE GOING TO USE TO SEND THE INFORMATION </s>
NOW THESE HAVE A WIRELESS RANGE OF UP TO ABOUT FIVE METRES WHICH IS SORT OF SUITABLE FOR ANYONE WHO'S WATCHING THE T. V. UNLESS THEY'RE IN A CINEMA </s>
WHICH NOT MOST PEOPLE DO SO AS WE'RE APPLYING TO THE MOST AUDIENCE THAT SHOULD BE FINE </s>
AND THEN I WAS UH JUST HAD A QUICK LOOK AT THE EXTERNAL DESIGN BUT I D I LEFT THAT MOSTLY TO THE UH INTERFACE DESIGNER </s>
AND SO THIS IS WHAT I HAD AS THE BASIC IDEA OF WHAT WE WANNA DO </s>
IT'S NOT A PROPER CIRCUIT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'D WORK OR NOT </s>
I'M NOT EVEN CONFIDENT THAT THOSE ARE THE REAL UM THE REAL WAY YOU'D WIRE IT UP BUT ANYWAY </s>
WE'VE JUST GOT THE THE POWER GOING TO THE INFRARED BULB WITH THE CHIP AND THE UH U. I. INTERFACE UM </s>
WHICH WOULD BASICALLY </s>
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PRESSED ANYTHING IT WOULD THE CHIP WOULD CONVERT IT INTO SOME FORM OF I. R. DATA WHICH COULD BE DECODED BY THE T. V. RECEIVER </s>
WHICH OBVIOUSLY MEANS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONFORM TO WHATEVER </s>
UM WHATEVER FORM OF COMMUNICATION THAT THE T. V. S ARE ALREADY USING AND SINCE THAT THAT'S ANOTHER USE AND REASON TO USE THAT INFRARED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT ALL T. V. S USE AT THE MOMENT </s>
AND THEN FINALLY </s>
UM WE WANT UH THE IT TO BE AVAILABLE TO A WIDE AUDIENCE AT A LOW COST SO ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT I'VE PUT FORWARD ARE UH LOW IN COST SO THAT THAT SHOULD BE GOOD </s>
UM IT SHOULD SHOULD BE DIFFERENT ENOUGH UM FROM THE ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS TO GET A GOOD CONSUMER BASE </s>
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT BEFORE AND ALSO JUST SOMETHING THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT </s>
UH BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALL THEY'RE ALSO EASY TO LOSE SO IF WE COULD LOOK INTO SOME WAY OF D DUNNO SOME ANTI GOING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE SOFA THING THAT YOU COULD HAVE </s>
I TH THAT WAS JUST SORT OF A GENERAL POINT THERE </s>
AND THAT'S UH YEAH </s>
ALRIGHT OKAY AND YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I CAME UP WITH THERE SO IF YOU WANNA </s>
OOH </s>

YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
JU UM JUST AS AN IDEA ON THE UH SPEECH RECOGNITION THING THAT PR IT'D PROBABLY BE QUITE EXPENSIVE TO INCORPORATE AN ENTIRE SPEECH RECOGNITION THING AND THEY'RE NOT THAT GREAT ANYWAY </s>
ALRIGHT OKAY </s>
ALRIGHT OKAY </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH BUT UM ON ON THAT AGAIN I JUST THOUGHT 'CAUSE YOU CAN GET THOSE KEY CHAINS NOW AND YOU WHISTLE AND THEN IT'LL LET OFF A LOUD NOISE TO LET YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS SO I THOUGHT THAT COULD BE QUITE A </s>

NO WELL NO 'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO PRESS THEM YOU JUST </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
MM </s>
BUT ALSO ER ERGONOMICS AS WE'RE SAYING WITH THE DIFFERENT DESIGNS </s>
ERGONOMICS UH THERE'S SORT OF PHYSICALLY DIFFERENT THINGS 'CAUSE UM IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN THE X. BOX THEY HAD TO MAKE TWO DIFFERENT SIZED CONTROLLERS BECAUSE PEOPLE IN JAPAN WOULDN'T BUY IT BECAUSE THE CONTROLLER WAS PHYSICALLY TO BIG BECAUSE UM </s>
THEY'RE C UH JUST GENERALLY JAPANESE PEOPLE HAVE SMALLER HANDS SO THEY COULDN'T GET ROUND THE CONTROLLER WHICH IS UH SO IF YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT 'CAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN HAVE BIGGER BUTTONS FOR SOME COUNTRIES OR SOMETHING AND SMALLER ONES FOR OTHERS </s>

IT'S NOT </s>

IT'S BEEN BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME IT'S JUST IT'S NOT VERY WELL ADVERTISED AS TO HOW TO USE IT AND THINGS </s>

THOUGH IF Y IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING LIKE SKY ANYWAY YOU CAN JUST CLICK ON IT YOU CAN JUST PRESS THE BUTTON ON THE PROGRAMME ONCE AND IT'LL RECORD THAT PROGRAMME WHEN IT'S ON AND YOU PRESS IT ON IT TWICE AND IT'LL RECORD THE WHOLE SERIES </s>
SO THAT YEAH </s>

OKAY UM I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FROM THE MARKETING POINT OF VIEW AND UH OBVIOUSLY OUR STARTING POINT WITH MARKETING IS ALWAYS MARKET RESEARCH </s>
UM SO THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED WE USED OUR OUR USABILITY LAB </s>
THE COMPANY'S USABILITY LAB WE DID OUR USUAL SELECTION METHODS TO GET A CROSS SECTION OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC </s>
MALE AND FEMALE ALL AGE GROUPS FROM FIFTEEN UPWARDS AND UM WE OBSERVED THEM IN THE LAB </s>
JUST THEIR GENERAL USE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN SEE WE HAD A HUNDRED SUBJECTS THERE </s>
OUR FINDINGS LOTS OF FINDINGS I'VE JUST SUMMARISED SOME OF THEM HERE </s>
THE OVERALL THING WHICH I'VE I'VE GOT AT THE TOP THERE IN ITALICS IS THAT USERS DISLIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS </s>
SO IT HAS OBVIOUS DESIGN IMPLICATIONS THERE </s>
UM WE FOUND THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY </s>
EIGHTY PERCENT WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY WE WERE QUITE SURPRISED BY THAT FINDING </s>
BUT UM THAT'S QUITE A HIGH PROPORTION OF OUR OUR YOU KNOW INTERNATIONAL TARGET GROUP ARE PREPARED TO SPEND MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT'S A BIT NICER LOOKING </s>
UM CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL WITH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER OVERALL </s>
FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE BELOW THERE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS ZAP A LOT SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR PERSON SUNK BACK IN THE SOFA CHANNEL HOPPING </s>
SO AGAIN THERE'S POWER IMPLICATIONS THERE </s>
UM FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS SO AGAIN A BIG DESIGN ISSUE THERE </s>
UM AND POSSIBLY WE CAN ALSO CUT BACK ON COST IF WE DON'T HAVE SO MANY FUNCTIONS ACTUALLY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL </s>
UM </s>
THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS THAT PEOPLE FOUND WITH REGARD TO PERSONAL PREFERENCES WERE UM SOMETHING THAT YOU YOU MENTIONED EARLIER UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST IN THE ROOM </s>
IT'S A SLIPPING DOWN THE BACK OF THE SOFA TYPE OF THING UH FIFTY PERCENT WERE WERE PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATED BY THAT </s>
UH THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF PEOPLE TAKE SAID THEY TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN TO USE AND I THINK THAT TIES IN WITH THE UM THE PREVIOUS FINDING OF PEOPLE ONLY USING TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS </s>
THEY JUST CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO LEARN ABOUT THE OTHER FUNCTIONS </s>
UM UM SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A QUARTER OF PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BAD FOR UH REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY </s>
YOU KNOW THOSE SMALL MOVEMENTS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL CAN LEAD TO KIND OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW PROBLEMS </s>
UM THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE THIRTY FIVE AND UNDER AGE GROUP WOULD LIKE UM A LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY AND SPEECH RECOGNITION </s>
AGAIN THAT WAS TO AID I THINK IN UH WHEN THEY'VE LOST THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTROL SOME KIND OF SPEECH RECOGNITION </s>
SOMETHING WE DIDN'T PUT TO THEM </s>
BUT WHICH I'M THINKING OF NOW IS UM EVEN IF PERHAPS THE LOST CONTROL CAN GIVE OFF A BLEEP EVERY NOW AND AGAIN TIL YOU FIND IT OR A FLASHING LIGHT </s>
POSSIBLY </s>
UM THAT TREND REVERSES IN THE OLDER AGE GROUPS </s>
SO THIRTY FIVES AND UNDERS WHO WOULD LIKE THOSE TWO FEATURES </s>
THAT KIND OF EVENS OUT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE AND IN THE OLDER AGE GROUP IT KIND OF REVERSES THEY'RE NOT SO BOTHERED WITH THIS </s>
I HAD MARVELLOUS TABLES AND THINGS THAT I COULD SHOW YOU BUT I THINK I'LL JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE </s>
IF THERE'S ANY MORE INFORMATION I CAN EMAIL YOU EXTRA DETAILS IS THAT OKAY </s>
MM-HMM SO CAN WE NOT PROGRAMME A VIDEO WITH THIS REMOTE CONTROL </s>
JUST CHANNEL HOPPING </s>
WOULD THAT IMPLY VIDEO USE </s>
MM-HMM YES </s>
YES </s>
UM WE DIDN'T REALLY LOOK INTO THAT BUT REMEMBER WE FOUND THAT FINDING THAT MOST PEOPLE ONLY USE ABOUT UH TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS </s>
I THINK TH TH THOSE DO TEND TO BE THE BASIC CHANNEL HOPPING THINGS AND ON AND OFF FOR THE VIDEO FAST FORWARDING </s>
SO ON AND I THINK IT'S SORT OF GENERAL KNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE DO FIND PROGRAMMING THEIR VIDEOS A NIGHTMARE </s>
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
IN FACT I'VE JUST CALLED UP THAT TABLE THERE WE ASKED THOSE TWO QUESTIONS THE TABLE RELATES TO BOTH QUESTIONS SO WE DIDN'T DIFFERENTIATE </s>
WOULD YOU PREFER AN L. C. D. SCREEN THAT'S MULTI FUNCTION REMOTE AND WOULD YOU PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL </s>
SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THE THE YES NO SORT OF VARIES ACROSS THE AGE GROUP THERE </s>
AND A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF DON'T KNOWS IN THE OLDER AGE GROUP I THINK THAT'S JUST GENERAL FEAR OF NEW TECHNOLOGY </s>
OH YEAH </s>
RIGHT </s>
MM </s>
YES </s>
THAT'S A SUPER IDEA </s>
YEAH </s>
YES FURTHER MARKET RESEARCH WILL BE NEEDED TO KIND OF FOCUS ON WHAT THAT IS </s>
IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT FOR A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD TH FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S SIXTY AND ALSO ACROSS THE WORLD IF WE'RE AIMING AT THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET </s>
WHAT IS UM ATTRACTIVE TO A TRENDY NEW YORKER AND WHAT IS ATTRACTIVE TO A RETIRED SOUTH AFRICAN I DUNNO YOU GET THE IDEA </s>
IT'S IT'S GONNA VARY AROUND THE WORLD </s>
AT THE END OF THE DAY TH THE ENGINEERING DESIGN IS ONE THING </s>
IT'S THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN THAT MAY AND TH THE SORT OF YOU KNOW FASHIONABLE ASPECT OF IT WE MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE FOR DIFFERENT MARKETS ROUND THE WORLD </s>
YEAH </s>
MM </s>
MM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YES IT WILL APPEAL TO SECTIONS OF THE MARKET DEF </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM MM </s>

I'M CONCERNED WHEN YOU READ THE THE R. S. I. ISSUE AGAIN REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY </s>
I DON'T THINK JUST MOVING YOUR FINGER AROUND ON A SMALL SCREEN IS GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT ENOUGH </s>
I THINK THAT IS STILL A KIND OF A QUESTION MARK ISSUE HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT </s>
UM R. S. I. TENDS TO BE CAUSED BY REPETITIVE SMALL MOVEMENTS </s>
I'M J I REALLY CAN'T GET MY HEAD ROUND THIS ONE THIS MAY HAVE TO BE POSTPONED TO A FUTURE MEETING BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT </s>
MM </s>
I KNOW AND IT BECOMES RIDICULOUS YES I KNOW </s>
YEAH </s>
YES </s>
MM-HMM </s>
DO WE HAVE TO INITIALLY UM YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE FINDINGS HERE FOCUS ON </s>
A YOUNGER AGE GROUP INITIALLY AND THEN BROADEN OUT THE MARKET LATER </s>
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GO FOR EVERYONE RIGHT AWAY </s>
UM </s>
MM </s>
AND WHEN WE'VE BEEN THROWING UP OUR IDEAS WE'RE AUTOMATICALLY TALKING ABOUT BUSINESS PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE TRENDY PEOPLE </s>
MM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM </s>
MM </s>
I'M JUST THINKING OF BUDGETARY ISSUES TOO FOR WHEN IT DOES GET TO THE SORT OF BROAD SCALE MARKETING STAGE </s>
WE WANT TO YOU KNOW NOT WASTE MONEY NOT BE PROFLIGATE AND UH </s>
YOU KNOW FOCUS ON WHERE THE IDEA WILL BE TAKEN UP </s>
FIRST IT'S MOST LIKELY TO BE TAKEN UP FIRST OF ALL WHERE THE MAIN PURCHASING POWER IS COMING FROM FOR A PRODUCT LIKE THIS </s>
MM </s>
RIGHT I'VE NOT COME ACROSS THAT FUNCTION BUT IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL </s>
AH HMM </s>
RIGHT </s>
SUPERB </s>
MM </s>
YES </s>
RIGHT </s>
EXCELLENT MM-HMM </s>
MM </s>
RIGHT </s>
CAN I JUST RUN THIS PAST YOU WHILE IT OCCURS TO ME I DON'T MEAN TO QUICKLY JUMP FROM ONE SUBJECT TO ANOTHER </s>
BUT JUST DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND TARGETING THE DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS IT OCCURS TO ME TO PRODUCE OUR OWN MOBILE PHONES </s>
THAT THAT'S KIND OF WHAT LED US ON TO COMPARING T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS WITH WITH THEIR DESIGN FEATURES UM CHAIN COMPANIES LIKE CARPHONE WAREHOUSE </s>
YOU CAN POP IN ANYTIME WITH A PHONE THAT YOU BOUGHT FOR THEM W IF YOU'VE GOT ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT AND THEY'LL FIX IT </s>
THEY'LL PHONE THE COMPANY YOU CAN USE THEIR TELEPHONES </s>
IS IT WORTHWHILE WITH WITH OUR RETAIL OUTLETS HAVING A A SIMILAR UM KIND OF SERVICE SO THAT IF OLDER USERS WERE DETERRED FROM BUYING THIS </s>
IF THEY KNOW THEY CAN JUST POP INTO ONE OF OUR HIGH STREET OUTLETS TH YOU KNOW WHICH BUTTON IS IT I PRESS FOR THIS </s>
TH AS FREE AS A FREE ASPECT OF OUR SERVICE WOULD THAT NOT MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THEM </s>
MM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
RIGHT </s>
ALRIGHT </s>
YES </s>
IF IT WAS SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS YOU COULDN'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL </s>
BUT I MEAN FOR IF THERE WERE ANY MORE OR ARE WE ABSOLUTELY DEFINITE IT'S ONLY GONNA BE FOR T. V. AND VIDEO </s>
WE'RE NOT GONNA PUT ANY OKAY JUST A THOUGHT </s>
OKAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
SURE </s>
MM </s>
YEAH </s>
NOT FOR SUCH SIMPLE FUNCTIONS BECAUSE WE'RE FOCUSING ON THAT YES OKAY </s>
MM </s>
PUTS PEOPLE OFF READING THEM SO THEY JUST DO THE OBVIOUS YES </s>
SURE OKAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM </s>
AND WE DON'T W I MEAN SO MANY REMOTE CONTROLS LOOK ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL THESE LONG </s>
BROWN THINGS WITH THE SAME COLOURED BUTTONS ALL CRAMMED IN ON THE S THE SURFACE </s>
WE DEFINITELY AN OB AN OBVIOUS THING A VERY SIMPLE THING IS TO GET AWAY FROM THESE BROWN RECTANGLES WE DON'T WANT THAT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
SLIGHTLY CURVED CURVED </s>
MM </s>
MM </s>
I MEAN LOOK AT THE MOBILE </s>
I THINK THAT'S THAT SOUNDS A REALLY ATTRACTIVE IDEA </s>
I'VE NOT COME ACROSS ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE IF IT KIND OF YEAH AND THAT OPENS OUT INTO YOUR FLIP TOP </s>
THEN IT'S NICE T TO H YOU CAN MAKE IT LIGHTWEIGHT PLASTIC </s>
NICE TO HOLD IN THE PALM OF THE HAND AND JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE HAVING TO ACTUALLY INSERT IN BETWEEN THE TWO COVERS </s>
THAT'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY TRYING P PREVENT A LOT OF THAT I WOULD THINK </s>
I THINK IT'S A REALLY NICE IDEA AND PLUS YOU CAN GET YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH WE'RE USING PLASTIC </s>
YOU CAN STILL I MEAN THINK OF THE DESIGNS YOU CAN GET IN PLASTIC WE CAN DO A NICE CONCH SHELL OR SCALLOP SHELL EXTERIOR </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
LESS CHANCE OF IT BEING LOST TOO </s>
IT'S NOT LIKE A CHOCOLATE BROWN LOZENGE THAT'S GONNA GO DOWN THE SOFA AND PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO PUT IT ON THEIR MANTELPIECE OR WHATEVER AS A KI IF IT LOOKS ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH AS A KIND OF ORNAMENT THEY DON'T NOT GONNA LOSE IT SO MUCH EITHER </s>
IT'S EASIER TO BIT NICE TO HANDLE </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
CAN I JUST QUICKLY UM GO OVER THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS SO THAT I HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING </s>
SO IT'S NO TELETEXT IT'S ONLY FOR T. V. AND BY IMPLICATION VIDEO OUR CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN THE REMOTE CONTROL UM SOMETHING ABOUT VIDEOPLUS </s>
RIGHT </s>
RIGHT </s>
RIGHT SO WHEN THEY PRESS FOR PROGRAMMING YOU IT COMES UP ON THE L. C. D. A REMINDER ABOUT USING VIDEOPLUS </s>
SO THAT THEY HAVE A LOOK AT THE GUIDE AND </s>
OR WAS IS THIS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS IS THIS JUST THAT WAS AN ADD ON FEATURE </s>
UH-HUH </s>
RIGHT </s>
RIGHT SO IT'S KIND OF DOING AWAY WITH THE PROGRAMMING FEATURE </s>
RIGHT </s>
MM AND THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES </s>
WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THERE THAT WE IN THE NEW NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS </s>
MM-HMM </s>
THAT'S NOT AT THE MOMENT A REQUIREMENT IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT </s>
WHAT PREFERENCE SO IT MAY COME ROUND TO MARKET RESEARCH AT SOME POINT TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE </s>
OKAY </s>
WHAT WOULD YOU SPECIFICALLY LIKE MARKETING TO LOOK AT BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING </s>
OR SHALL I JUST SORT OF GENERALLY LOOK AT ALL THE ISSUES INVOLVED </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
WHOOPS QUESTIONNAIRE FOUR </s>
'CAUSE WE'RE AT LUNCHTIME NOW I THINK </s>

MM </s>
AFTER LUNCH </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
'KAY </s>
YEP </s>
'KAY </s>
FINE </s>
IT'S OKAY WITH ME </s>
YEP </s>
REGARDING THOSE SIZES WHICH ONE YOU THINK WILL BE LIGHT BECAUSE WE WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SIZE ALSO </s>
SO MAYBE A STANDARD TRIPLE A. MIGHT TAKE LESSER SPACE OR AND DYNAMO MIGHT TAKE MORE SPACE </s>
UH </s>
RIGHT </s>
NIGHT </s>
AND ARE THESE LIKE UH WHAT ARE THE LIFE OF THE KINETIC BATTERY IT LIKE IT RUNS FOR LONG TIME </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
WE C </s>
SOLAR WOULD BE SLIGHTLY EXPENSIVES </s>
IT'S TWELVE POINT F </s>
ANOTHER QUESTION IS LIKE SORRY </s>
W W WHICH ONE WOULD LAST THE LONGEST BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT CUSTOMERS TO BE LIKE YOU KNOW CHARGING LIKE A MOBILE PHONE EVERY DAY </s>
A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE SO WE HAVE TO S LOOK AT THE LIFE ALSO </s>
OKAY </s>
SO </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
SECOND THING IS YEAH AND SECOND QUESTION IS LIKE A MOBILE YOU CAN CHANGE THE COVER YOU CALL IT A SKIN OR WHATEVER </s>
SO IN THIS CASE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIKE A CUSTOMER CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR LIKE FROM GREEN PARROT GREEN TO CHILLI RED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT </s>
SO IS THAT FEATURE AVAILABLE IN LIKE UH TITANIUM OR IT'S LIKE ONLY SPECIFIC TO PLASTIC OR </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
SOMETHING LIKE </s>
ALRIGHT </s>
THAT COULD BE A GOOD IDEA </s>
IT COULD IT WOULD BE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD ON ALSO </s>
SORRY I DIDN'T GET THE LAST PART YOU'RE TALKING OF </s>
JUST WHAT YOU SAID I I DIDN'T GET THE UH MEANING OF IT COMPLETELY YOU'RE SAYING LIKE </s>
UH-HUH </s>
OKAY </s>
'KAY </s>
ABSOLUTELY F FOR SOMEBODY WHO VERY OFTEN </s>
IF HE WOULD A PERSON WHO SWITCHES CHANNELS VERY OFTEN OR DOES USE A PARTICULAR FUNCTION VERY OFTEN WILL FIND IT VERY IRRITATING TO USE A AND HE MIGHT SPOIL THE TOUCH PAD VERY FAST COMPARED TO A BUTTON LIKE </s>
IF YOU KEEP PUNCHING WITH AN POINTER OR WHATEVER </s>
AND JUST ONE SMALL QUESTION BEFORE LIKE YOU ARE REGARDING THE CIRCUIT SINCE WE ARE HAV HAVING A FLIP TOP </s>
WE CAN CUSTOMISE THE TWO CIRCUITS FOR DIFFERENT TYPE OF BUTTONS LIKE WE ARE KEEPING THE STANDARD BUTTONS ON THE TOP AND THE MORE COMPLEX BUTTONS UNDER THIS THING </s>
SO WE CAN DIVIDE THE CIRCUIT LIKE YOU KNOW </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY UH </s>
WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOMETHING WHICH I DID HERE </s>
FIRST THING IS UH BASICALLY ON DESIGN WE JUST TOOK THE INPUT FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING </s>
ESPECIALLY FROM THE MARKETING AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGN TO CHECK ON THE CUSTOMER NEEDS AND FEASIBILITY </s>
SECOND IS WE CHECKED INTO COMPETITORS THE PICTURE HERE SHOWS ONE OF THE STANDARD MODELS OFFERED BY COMPETITORS HERE </s>
SO Y YOU GENERALLY SEE THERE'S NOT MUCH OF VARIETY AND LIKE MARKETING TEAM SAID UH PEOPLE NEED TRENDY THEY ARE BORED OF BLACK AND WHITE </s>
SO YOU GENERALLY SEE RECTANGULAR SHAPE VERY MONOTONOUS KIND OF DESIGNS HERE </s>
AND UH SECOND THING IS THERE'S TOO MUCH OF CONFUSION HERE </s>
NO PARTICULAR REMOTE IS STANDARD </s>
LIKE SOME SOME PEOPLE HAVE A </s>
HERE YOU SEE THIS </s>
THIS IS ON A I I </s>
I FOUND TH THAT UH ONLY COMMON FEATURE IS THE CH UH CHANNEL CONTROL AND UH VOLUME CONTROL </s>
REST OTHER BUTTONS THEY ARE IN A VERY DISORGANIZED AND THEY ARE NOT CONSISTENT TH WITH OTHER MODELS AND ALL </s>
OKAY AND SECOND AS ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH WILLIAM </s>
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE M MAYBE A G. G. U. I. INTERFACE IN THE F IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLIP TOP AND G GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE BASICALLY WHICH IS WHAT WE D DO IN COMPUTER </s>
HAVE ICONS OR TOUCH PAD OR WHATEVER WHICH IS </s>
LIKE YOU HAVE ON A L UH ICONS OR SOMETHING Y YOU HAVE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF G. U. I. GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE </s>
SO BASICALLY NOT POINT OR CLICK </s>
PRESS ANY PARTICULAR DEVICE HE JUST HAS TO CLICK ON THAT PARTICULAR ICON TO SIMPLIFY </s>
AND ON THE TOP M REPETITIVE BUTTONS WHICH ARE LIKE VOLUME OR CHANNEL CHANGING AND ALL COULD BE ON THE POINTING DEVICE THAT MEANS THE USE OF BUTTON </s>
SO HE NEED NOT USE A POINTER TO KEEP CHANGING THE CHANNEL IF A PERSON IS FREQUENT SURFER </s>
SO WE ARE HAVING A COMBINATION OF BOARDS SO F ON THE S SIMPLER BOARD </s>
ON THE TOP WE HAVE THIS BUTTON RUBBER BUTTONS TO KEEP FREQUENTLY CHANGING THE CHANNELS </s>
BUT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY AND YOU MEAN TO THE </s>
AND THE LOWER DISTANCE </s>
OH F PERFECT </s>
SO THE FINDINGS ARE TOO MANY CLUTTERED BUTTONS </s>
REPETITION OF CERTAIN BUT BUTTONS WHICH I ALREADY EXPLAINED EXAMPLE THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL BUTTONS </s>
ALL ARE CONFUSING AND IN INCONSISTENT </s>
OKAY WE HAD A LATEST FINDING OF VOICE RECOGNITION THERE WAS A MAIL </s>
WHICH MENTIONS THAT OUR DIVISION HAS DEVELOPED A NEW SPEECH RECOGNITION S FEATURE </s>
WE HAVE TO CHECK INTO THE FOR FINANCIAL F FEASIBILITY WHETHER WE CAN INCORPORATE IT THIS AT A LOW COST </s>
BUT FOR LIKE WE HAD G UM S RESPONSE FROM THE CUSTOMERS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE FEATURE OF FINDING IT </s>
SO IT COULD BE LIKE WHERE IS THE REMOTE AND THE REMOTE ANSWERS I AM HERE </s>
SOME KIND OF THING OR IT GIVES A B BLEEP SOUND OR SOME KIND OF SOUND AND IF THIS CAN BE INCORPORATED THIS WOULD BE MORE UH YOU CAN SAY TRENDY ALSO </s>
AND TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE ALSO </s>
SO WE WE CAN CHECK INTO THE FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING THIS </s>
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES WOULD BE LIKE AS ALREADY UH MARKETING DEPARTMENT </s>
THEY WANT SOMETHING TO DO WITH FRUIT SO I WOULDN'T SAY THE DESIGN SHOULD BE LIKE A FRUIT </s>
BUT YEAH WE CAN TAKE INSPIRATION FROM FRUIT COLOURS LIKE THE VIBRANT COLOURS UH RED CHILLI UH </s>
TOMATO RED OR WHATEVER AND SECOND THING IS CER CERTAIN STANDARD BUTTONS WE SHOULD HAVE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I IF YOU SEE THE PREVIOUS SLIDE UH </s>
I THINK MOST OF THE USERS WOULD NOW BE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THIS CER CENTRAL PATTERN HERE </s>
SO WE WE WE WOULD NOT CHANGE H THAT PARTICULAR PATTERN BECAUSE I THIS IS THE MOST CONSISTENT THING IN ALL REMOTE CONTROLS </s>
THIS IS CENTRAL ONE THE ONE YOU YEAH VOLUME AND CHANNEL </s>
SO KEEP THAT M THAT STANDARDISED BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST COMMON FEATURE ACROSS ALL MODELS IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE MODELS IT'S HERE </s>
THIS </s>
AND </s>
VOICE RECOGNITION </s>
THE KINETIC </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MAYBE WE COULD START WITH THE BLACK AND WHITE </s>
THAT THAT WAY WE COULD UPGRADE LATER </s>
MM </s>
YEAH </s>
AND FOR THE SORRY </s>
FOR THE BODY DESIGN I THINK PLASTIC UH W YEAH WE COULD USE THE BODY </s>
FOR THE INSIDE AND UH RUBBER AS A PADDING OR FOR THE GRIP SOMETHING LIKE TO ADD TO THE DESIGN </s>
PLAST RIGHT </s>
IT'S </s>
UH I IT'S DIFFERENT </s>
RIGHT </s>
ACUPRESSURE YOU COULD TALK OF ACUPRESSURES </s>
AND FINALLY THE BODY SHOULD BE RETOUCHABLE MAY MAYBE CH YOU CAN CHANGE THE BODY OR THE CASE CASING THE CASE OUTSIDE </s>
IT SHOULD BE MOULDED IT WITH THE DESIGN IN SUCH A WAY YOU CAN CHANGE IT EVERY TIME </s>
OKAY </s>
THE RUBBER </s>
FINE </s>
YEAH </s>
FINE UH WE WERE TALKING OF VOICE RECOGNITION ALSO BECAUSE THAT WE ARE NOT FOR HOW TO LOOK IT UH REMOTE CONTROL IF IT'S LOST </s>
SO ARE WE LOOKING AT VOICE </s>
OR MAYBE LIKE UH WILLIAM WAS SUGGESTING IN THE LAST THING SOME DEVICES YOU PUT ON KEY CHAINS </s>
FOR L YEAH THE WHISTLE </s>
SO WE CAN IF FINANCIALLY VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT FEASIBLE WE COULD GO FOR A WHISTLE </s>
YEP </s>
UH SORRY I DIDN'T MENTION THIS BUT WE'LL BE INCORPORATING IN THE DESIGN </s>
FINE </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
AGAIN A QUESTIONNAIRE HUH </s>
I THINK WE ARE PRETTY GOING IN A CLEAR DIRECTION NOW </s>
I'LL WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE ALL UM HOOKED UP </s>
OKAY </s>
PUT IT ON IN THAT WAY </s>
THANKS </s>
OKAY </s>
WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY HOPE YOU'VE HAD FUN </s>
RIGHT UM THIS IS OUR CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING UM I THINK WE'RE SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF OURSELVES </s>
FROM THE LAST MEETING I TH I I THINK YEAH UM </s>
THIS IS WHERE WE TALK ABOUT UM PROPERTIES MATERIALS USER INTERFACE AND TREND WATCHING </s>
SO I THINK WE'VE TOUCHED ON A FEW THINGS </s>
TO DO WITH THAT ALREADY BUT WE'LL JUST GO OVER IT </s>
UM </s>
THE MINUTES FROM THE LAST TIME </s>
UM WE HAD A COUPLE OF UM CHANGES IN OUR PLANS IN THAT WE COULDN'T USE TELETEXT </s>
IT WASN'T GONNA BE A CONTROL FOR EVERYTHING UM AND THAT WE HAD TO INCORPORATE THE IMAGE OF THE COMPANY INTO IT SOMEHOW </s>
UM </s>
WE HAVE DECIDED ON A LEAVING OUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION WE'VE DECIDED ON THERE BEING A FLIP DESIGN AND UM A DIFFERENT SHAPE FROM WHAT'S NORMAL </s>
WE WERE THINKING A SHELL BUT SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES JUST A DIFFERENT SHAPE FROM WHAT'S NORMAL UM </s>
YOU WERE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES </s>
AND WE WERE GONNA THINK ABOUT THE PORT AND AN ALARM FOR GETTING IT LOST THINGS LIKE THAT </s>
UM AND OUR MARKET WAS GOING TO BE YOUNG BUSINESS KIND OF RANGE </s>
OKAY SO SHALL WE START WITH THE FIRST PRESENTATION </s>
YES IF YOU FEEL </s>
IT'S OKAY </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH </s>

I MEAN PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN BASEMENT FLATS THERE'S NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE </s>
MM BUT THEN IT WOULD BE CHARGING THROUGH THE DAY </s>
I THINK THE POINT IS THAT IT CHARGES THROUGH THE DAY AND THEN YOU'VE GOT IT CHARGED FOR THE EVENING </s>
OKAY </s>
YEAH I'VE SEEN </s>

BECAUSE </s>
WHERE AM I </s>
IF IT IS THE KINETIC THING AND IT IS SMALL AND IT IS PORTABLE AND IT IS A DIFFERENT SHAPE AND THE KINETIC IS SOMETHING PEOPLE DON'T DO KIND OF WE'RE DOING SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND DIFFERENT UM BUT IF YOU WORE IT IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU COULD JUST CLIP ON YOUR POCKET THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THAT LESS </s>

'CAUSE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE LOOKED AT LAST TIME AREN'T UN UNFORTUNATELY AREN'T AVAILABLE </s>
UM FINDINGS I'VE GOT MY NICE LITTLE PICTURE THERE </s>
THIS IS UH THE CHIP CALLED THE T. A. DOUBLE ONE EIGHT THREE FIVE WHICH IS WHAT'S USED IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE IT SENDS OUT STANDARD SIGNALS </s>
BASED ON YOUR INPUT AND UM IT'S PRETTY MUCH USED FOR ALL ALL T. V. REMOTES AT THE MOMENT </s>
UM AND THEN WE WE'RE LOO LOOKING INTO BATTERY OPTIONS </s>
THERE'S UM ACTUALLY NO RECHARGEABLE OPTION AVAILABLE </s>
SO WE I SAW THE UM THE STANDARD DOUBLE A. AND TRIPLE A. WHICH WE THOUGHT WERE A BIT BIT TOO BULKY AT THE MOMENT </s>
DYNAMO CHARGING I THOUGHT THAT THAT MIGHT BE A BIT SILLY TO BE TO BE HONEST PEOPLE WON'T IT'S IT'S BASICALLY LIKE WIND UP RADIO </s>
SO YOU WIND UP YOUR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE YOU USE IT </s>
IT MIGHT </s>
YOU </s>
YEAH YEAH OH YEAH I PRESU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO WIND IT FOR VERY LONG </s>
BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY SORT OF NECESSARY WHEN YOU TH YOU THINK OF THE NEXT TWO OPTIONS </s>
LIKE THE THE SOLAR CHARGING 'CAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVE THE LIGHT ON IN THE ROOM ANYWAY SO THEY COULD GET WHEN WHEN YOU GOT T. V. </s>
NO </s>
IS IT </s>
ALRIGHT I </s>
YEAH IT WOULD THE D YEAH THE DYNAMO WOULD TAKE MORE SPACE 'CAUSE YOU ACTUALLY NEED A PHYSICAL SORT OF HANDLE TO WIND UP </s>
YEAH OKAY </s>
BUT </s>
YEAH AND MOST PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE ALSO WATCH T. V. IN THE IN THE NIGHT ANYWAY </s>
BUT I I THINK I THINK THE THE NEXT ONE'S THE BEST ANYWAY </s>
THE THE KINETIC CHARGING WHICH IS LIKE YOU GET IT IN R YOU GET IT IN WRIST WATCHES AND YOU D YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE IT </s>
I MEAN THE AMOUNT THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLY MOVING AROUND YOU'D BE DOING ALL THE TIME WOULD WOULD CHARGE IT UP </s>
I DON'T THINK YOU'D EVER NEED TO ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY START SHAKING IT UP TO MAKE IT WORK </s>
UM YEAH IT'S IT CHARGES INTO UM SOME FORM OF IT'S A SMALLER CELL WHICH IT CHARGES INTO AND UH THE SI THE SIZE SORT OF A WATCH A WATCH BATTERY </s>
'CAUSE THEY USE THEM QUITE FREQUENTLY IN WATCHES </s>
AND THAT'LL THAT WOULD L WOULD LAST FOR UM WELL I DO I D I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE RUN OUT </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH AND </s>
YEAH BUT THEN AGAIN I I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE WATCH </s>
ALTHOUGH IT'S ONLY A TINY AMOUNT IT'S IT'S UM IT'S ALWAYS MOVING FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND THEY DON'T RUN OUT OVER NIGHT WHEN YOU LEAVE THEM ON THE SIDE </s>
AND TH FOR THE SAME THE SAME REASON </s>
YOU'RE ONLY USING IT FOR A V INCREDIBLY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME JUST TO SEND THE SIGNAL AND THEN YOU'RE FINISHED WITH IT AND YOU PUT IT NO NO I DO I DON'T THINK THE THE DRAW ON IT WOULD BE </s>
MM </s>
YE YEAH I THINK I TH UH G Y YOU COULD HAVE A DUAL UM POWER THING BUT THE THE THING WITH THE SOLAR CELLS IS YOU WOULD NEED TO PUT THEM ON THE CASE AND THEY BECAUSE </s>
IF YOU LIE ON A CALCULATOR THEY THEY'RE QUI THEY'RE QUITE BIG AND THEY ALL THEY ALL LOOK I IDENTICAL </s>
THEY'RE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE THEY DON'T </s>
YEAH THE NORMAL BATTERIES WOULD BE THE CHEAPEST I'D PRESUME THEN IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE THE THE SOLAR CHARGING ONES UM BUT THE </s>
IT'S I I THINK THEY'RE NOT VERY RESISTANT TO DROPPING </s>
'CAUSE IF YOU DROP STUFF YEAH IF YOU IF YOU HAVE Y THE SIZE YOU'D NEED TO CHARGE A REMOTE WOULDN'T BE THAT BIG BUT I MEAN IF REMOTES ALWAYS GET THROWN AROUND AND STUFF </s>
SO </s>
Y I THINK YEAH PRACTICALLY </s>
I MEAN CALCULATORS YOU DON'T REALLY THROW AROUND A LOT WHEREAS REMOTES YOU DO THEY CAN T </s>
YEAH THEY DO THEY YEAH THEY'VE GOT DUAL THINGS BUT THEY'RE THE BATTERIES ARE SMALLER I THINK </s>
MM </s>
W M YEAH SO THE </s>
YEAH THE THE S IF YOU IF YOU HAD SOMETHING DU UH USING THE STANDARD </s>
BATTERIES AND THE SOLAR CHARGING UM </s>
I DON'T THINK YOU'D I THINK THE IT WOULD D WELL YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE STANDARD DOUBLE A. S WOULD LAST IN OR TRIPLE A. S WOULD LAST </s>
YEAH I THINK I I THINK IT WOULD YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY WELL I'LL MOVE ON </s>
UM MY SECOND PART OF MY FINDINGS UH THE MO MOST CURRENT REMOTES USE THIS SILICONE UH P. C. B. BOARD WHICH PR PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD </s>
WHICH BASICALLY HAS THESE CONTACTS THAT ARE REALLY CLOSE TOGETHER AND THEN WHEN YOU PRESS DOWN ON THE RUBBER BUTTON </s>
IT'LL CONNECT THE CIRCUIT AND EACH EACH SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO TWO UH DIFFERENT LEGS ON THE CHIP AND SO SENDS A DIFFERENT MESSAGE AND THAT THEN UH GETS TRANSLATED BY THE CHIP INTO A CODE AND THEN IT'S FIRED OUT OF THIS L. E. D. IN THE SEQUENCE OF L ON AND OFF BURSTS </s>
WELL </s>
WELL THIS THE THI THE THING ABOUT IS UM </s>
THEY THEY CAN BE AS BIG OR AS SMALL AS YOU WANT THEM TO BE BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN PRINT CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE THAT THAT IT'S IT'S SIMPLY SPACED LIKE THAT SO YOU CAN HAVE FIT THE N THE SIZE OF THE NINE BUTTONS IN </s>
IF YOU IF YOU SEE HOW THIN THE TRACKS ARE </s>
YOU COULD YOU COULD S YOU COULD PUT THEM VIRTUALLY RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MUCH SMALLER SWITCH ON EACH ONE </s>
IF YOU IF YOU WANTED TO BUT UM THE THERE IS AN OPTION TO DO TO DO IT LIKE THAT OR YOU COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF </s>
ARRAY OF SWITCHES WHICH I'LL SPEAK ABOUT IN THE NEXT BIT SO THAT </s>
AND THEN TO UH YEAH SO TO CONSERVE BATTERY LIFE THE REMOTE SHOULD BE IN A STANDBY MODE NO WHILE NOT BEING USED </s>
NOW WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT WAS 'CAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN Y WHEN YOU HAVE THESE THINGS THEY'VE GOT LITTLE LIGHTS ON BEHIND THE BUTTONS </s>
SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT ALL THE BUTTONS ARE LIKE ON A MOBILE PHONE THEY DO IT MORE OFTEN THAN ON A THAN ON A T. V. REMOTE </s>
BUT YOU COULD YOU COULD HAVE LIGHTS BEHIND THE BUTTONS AND UM AFTER LIKE FIVE OR TEN SECONDS OF NOT BEING USED I'D HAVE THAT TURNED OFF </s>
IF WE DECIDED TO GO FOR BUTTONS THAT COULD LIGHT UP </s>
UM THE CASE MATERIAL I'VE A BEEN SENT WHAT THE FACTORY CAN ACTUALLY GIVE US </s>
THE THERE'S THE PLASTIC WHICH I THINK WE WERE GONNA GO FOR ANYWAY AS THE MAIN CASE CASE HOUSING AND </s>
THE THE MAIN PROBLEMS WITH THE WELL YOU COULD GO FOR WOOD BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A BIT IMPRACTICAL </s>
TITANIUM UM VERY EXPENSIVE JUST TO PROCESS WHICH TO MAKE IT IS EXPENSIVE AND RUBBER </s>
WELL YOU'RE SAYING THAT PEOPLE LIKE THIS UH SPONGY FEEL THIS YEAR SO PERHAPS UH SOME SOMETHING MADE OF RUBBER </s>
BUT I WAS THINKING MORE OF THE BUTTONS BECAUSE THE BUTTONS WHICH THEY'VE THEY'VE SAID </s>
THAT THEY'VE THEY'VE PUT ACROSS </s>
ARE WHAT IS USED IN SOME STRESS BALL MANUFACTURE AND IT'S MEANT TO BE ANTI R. S. I. </s>
I'M NO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WOULD WORK BECAUSE SURELY YOUR FINGERS WOULD STILL BE MOVING OVER THE SHORT DISTANCES BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID </s>
UM THE PROBLEM WITH THE CASING IS THAT UH THERE'S </s>
QUITE UM THERE'S QUITE A FEW DESIGN RESTRICTIONS THAT THEY'VE GOT ON THE SHAPE OF THE CASE </s>
IF YOU GO FOR TITANIUM THEY CAN ONLY DO A STANDARD BOX SHAPE </s>
WHEREAS IF YOU COME TO PLASTIC THEY CAN THEY CAN BE A LITTLE MORE THEY CAN THEY CAN DO SORT OF CURVED SHAPES </s>
BUT WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT BECAUSE WE'D HAVE IT IN TWO SEPARATE UNITS </s>
FOR THE FLIP PHONE </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH I TH </s>
UH </s>
YEAH IN IN TITANIUM I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE AT ALL REALLY </s>
THE JU JUST IT W WELL YOU COULD MAKE IT AVAILABLE IN THE TITANIUM </s>
IT WAS JUST IT WOULD BE SO EXPENSIVE TO BUY A NEW CASE FOR IT </s>
BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OF HOW MUCH TITANIUM IS IS IT'S LIGHT AND STRONG BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE LEFT FOR AIRCRAFT DESIGN RATHER THAN FOR </s>
FOR A REMOTE </s>
YEAH YEAH </s>
RUBBER YEAH </s>
AND YOU CAN PEEL THEM OFF YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
ALSO THE JUST JUST GOING BACK TO THE INTERFACE DESIGNS WITH THE BUTTONS THE I KNO WE WERE PLANNING TO DO SOME SORT OF TOUCH SCREEN </s>
NOW WHAT I WAS SAYING BEFORE ABOUT INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU COULD HAVE JUST A BARE P. C. B. CIRCUIT BOARD AND I'M SURE YOU COULD PROBABLY GET IT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS AND SO JUST BY TOUCHING IT WITH YOUR FINGER IT'D MAKE THE CONNECTION </s>
OVER IF YOU HAD THEM CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WOULD BE ONE OPTION </s>
UM THE SECOND OPTION TH THEY OFFER RUBBER BUTTONS </s>
BUT I THOUGHT THAT AN L. C. D. TYPE OF SCREEN 'CAUSE ONE THEY'RE INCREDIBLY THIN UM AND DON'T TAKE UP MUCH SPACE </s>
TWO THEY YOU CAN HAVE THEM IN A SORT OF ARRAY AND YOU CAN ARRANGE THE BUTTONS ON THE SCREEN IN A SORT OF SET THING AND YOU COULD HAVE THEM LIKE A TOUCH </s>
DISPLAY </s>
UH WHAT WHAT </s>
OH ON THE ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU COULD BECAU YOU COULD FIT IT THE PROBLEM WITH IT BASICALLY IS THAT IT'S FLAT AND SO YOU CAN'T DO LOTS OF CURVE CURVED THINGS WITH IT </s>
BUT UM YOU CAN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WITH THE L. C. D. YOU'D HAVE THE WIRES COMING OFF YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT WITH THE </s>
WITH THE L. C. D. YOU'D ONLY HAVE THAT WITH THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD </s>
WITH </s>
W ALSO WITH THE </s>
YEAH </s>
YOU COULD HAVE A FLAT SCREEN INSIDE YEAH BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER WE WANT AN L. C. D. SCREEN INSIDE </s>
IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE FULL COLOUR IT WOULD JUST BE BLACK AND WHITE BUT THERE'D BE TOUCH TOUCH BUTTONS </s>
SO YOU WOULDN'T BE PRESSING DOWN ON 'EM W OR WE COULD HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS WHICH ARE MADE OF THIS MATERIAL WHICH IS ANTI R. S. I. </s>
IS RUBBER </s>
MM </s>
YEAH I HADN'T I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT OF THAT TO BE HONEST </s>
YEAH YOU COULD </s>
YOU COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF STYLUS THAT YOU COULD PULL OUT BUT I I THINK THEY COULD GET A BIT EASILY LOST 'CAUSE I HAD </s>
HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH OKAY </s>
YEAH THAT'S YEAH THAT THAT'S THE END OF M MY </s>
YEAH </s>
UH YEAH </s>
YEAH YEAH THAT THAT WOULD BE FAIRLY SIMPLE </s>
I MEAN YOU'D YOU'D ACTUALLY HAVE TWO SEPARATE YOU'D HAVE TWO SEPARATE CIRCUIT BOARDS BUT THEY'D BE JOINED BY WIRES OR LIKE SOME CABLING BETWEEN THEM </s>
'CAUSE IN THE IN THE ACTUAL FLIP BIT YOU'D HAVE SOME LINKING </s>
MM </s>
UM </s>
YEAH </s>
I MEAN YOU CAN YOU COULD DO IT </s>
YOU COULD HAVE A 'CAUSE IF YOU IF YOU JUST PUT THE FULL CHARGE THROUGH AN L. C. D. DISPLAY IT'LL COMPLETELY BLANK IT OUT </s>
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD GET ANY MIRROR EFFECT ON IT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
IF YOU IF YEAH IF YOU HAVE LIKE BUTTONS THAT APPEAR ON THE SCREEN IN THIS L. C. D. SCREEN </s>
YEAH </s>

YEAH YEAH BUT YOU CAN DO IT WITH YOUR THUMB LI </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
WELL YEAH WE </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
MM </s>
YEAH I THINK I MEAN IF </s>
YEAH IT IS IT IS QUI IT'S QUITE A COOL FEATURE TO HAVE AND ALSO IF THEY'VE GOT IT IF THEY'VE GOT THESE PARTS ALREADY IN STOCK </s>
THEN IT WON'T BE CHEAP TO RE MANUFACTURE THEM UH OR IT WILL BE CHEAP SORRY TO RE MANUFACTURE THEM </s>
SO DO YOU RECKON THAT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT WHERE'S THE REMOTE I'M HERE THING </s>
I THINK THAT WOULD BE QUITE FUN </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH TO S TH WELL IT'S IT'S NOT AS EXPENSIVE AS IT WOULD BE IF IT WAS FULL COLOUR 'CAUSE IF WE'VE JUST GOT A BLACK AND WHITE ONE </s>
I MEAN THEY USE THEM IN CALCULATORS SO </s>
YEAH </s>
WELL YOU COU UM </s>
K NO THE KINETIC ONES COME COME WITH UM A SORT OF W WATCH A BATTERY THAT GOES IN A WATCH </s>
SO IT'S A LOT SMALLER SO IT WOULD </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH THE WELL I THINK WERE WE'RE GOING FOR THE L. C. D. ON THAT ONE ON THE BUTTONS </s>
ON THE ON THE ON ON THE TOP ONE WE'RE GONNA YEAH </s>
ON THE BOTTOM WE WERE GONNA HAVE THE RUBBER THE RUBBER ONES THE ANTI R. S. I. ONES </s>
UM OKAY ON WE'VE GOT THE FLIP THE FLIP SCREEN THE TOP ONE IS GONNA BE THE L. C. D. AND THE BOTTOM ONE IS GONNA BE THE RUBBERISED BUTTONS </s>

YEAH YEAH J WITH THESE RUBBER THESE RUBBERISED CA NOT THE ACTUAL UH PLASTIC OUTSIDE CASE JUST THE RUBBER THING THAT GOES ROUND THE OUTSIDE </s>
OH YEAH YEAH THE WHISTLE ONES YEAH </s>

AND THEY'VE GOT IN STOCK SO YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
DID IT </s>
OH GOOD GRIEF </s>
'KAY </s>
OH </s>
MM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
SHALL I </s>
OKAY </s>
WE JUST CONNECT UP </s>
THANK YOU </s>
THERE WE GO </s>
OKAY UM SO WE DECIDED ON OUR MARKET AND SO THIS FEEDBACK FROM THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT IS REALLY ABOUT TREND WATCHING </s>
UM </s>
THE METHODS WE USED TO DECIDE ON UH </s>
CURRENT TRENDS AND SO ON MARKET TRENDS </s>
WERE THAT WE DID OUR TRADITIONAL UH OUR USUAL MARKET RESEARCH STUDY UH WITH A HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THE THE GENERAL FEEDBACK FROM THEM IS THAT THE MOST IM UH W I'M SORRY I'M SLIGHTLY TONGUE TIED AFTER LUNCH </s>
SORRY PROJECT MANAGER </s>
UM WE DECIDED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT I UH REQUIRED IN A REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE AND WE'LL COME TO THAT LATER </s>
SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID </s>
ALSO WITH OUR COMPANY UM BEING FORERUNNERS IN UH PUTTING FASHION INTO TECHNOLOGY </s>
WE ALSO LOOKED AT A FASHION UPDATE UM USING OUR CONSULTANTS ON FASHION AND DESIGN IN PARIS AND MILAN </s>
UH SO THE GENERAL FINDINGS FROM THAT WAS UH IN THE MARKET TRENDS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR REMOTE CONTROLS WERE PEOPLE WANT A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL </s>
RATHER THAN THE THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL OF REMOTE CONTROLS </s>
THEY ALSO ALSO WANT A REMOTE CONTROL TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE </s>
AND OF COURSE AS WE PREDICTED THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE </s>
NOW I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE FIRST OF THOSE FINDINGS FANCY LOOK AND FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT </s>
IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SECOND TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE WHICH IS IN TURN TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS BEING EASY TO USE </s>
SO POSSIBLY THAT THE FEATURE THAT WE PUT FIRST IS ACTUALLY THIRD IS STILL IMPORTANT </s>
BUT IT'S THIRD IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE FOR THE THE SUBJECT GROUP WE LOOKED AT </s>
OKAY UM NOW THE FASHION UPDATE WHICH RELATES TO VERY PERSONAL PREFERENCES AMONG OUR SUBJECT GROUP </s>
UM WE FOUND FROM OUR UM CONSULTANTS IN PARIS AND MILAN WHO DES ATTENDED ALL THE DESIGN AND FASHION FAIRS THERE </s>
THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE GOING TO BE THE THEME FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE </s>
SO SHOULD WE BE THINKING OF USING SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL DESIGN TOO </s>
THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE UM A TREND TOWARDS A SPONGY FEEL TO MATERIALS UH AGAIN IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR </s>
SO A LOT OF INTERESTING FEEDBACK THERE BOTH FROM OUR MARKET RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS AND FROM OUR PEOPLE IN PARIS AND MILAN </s>
BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT OUR DESIGN PEOPLE MAKE OF THAT </s>
UNLESS ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT </s>
NOT YET </s>
'KAY </s>
OKAY </s>
I KNOW </s>
DOES DOES LIGHT CHARGE AS AS SUNLIGHT DOES </s>
ARTIFICIAL LIGHT </s>
HAS TO BE SOLAR </s>
MM </s>
ARTIFICIAL LIGHT NO </s>
THAT'S GOING TO </s>
I KNOW DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD TOO IF WE'RE IF WE'RE MARKETING INTERNATIONALLY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM </s>
COULD I JUST ASK REFERRING BACK TO SOLAR CHARGING IS THAT COMPATIBLE WITH UM STANDARD BATTERIES </s>
I MEAN </s>
COULD PEOPLE PUT STANDARD BATTERIES IN BUT WITH A S YOU KNOW THEY COULD LEAVE IT IN THE SUNLIGHT FOR SOLAR CHARGING OR THE TWO THINGS NOT COMPATIBLE </s>
MM </s>
SO THAT AFFECTS THE EXTERIOR DESIGN </s>
MM </s>
AGAIN IT DE </s>
MM </s>
IT WOULD JUST DETRACT FROM THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE OF THE WHOLE FEATURE I IT'S NOT GONNA ADD ANYTHING OKAY </s>
SHOULDN'T WE DO SOME MARKET RESEARCH ON THAT FIRST BEFORE WE ADD IT IN BECAUSE I I PERSONALLY RIGHT OKAY </s>
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP IN ANY OF OUR UH FOCUS GROUPS AND MARKET RESEARCH IT'S NOT A THING THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR </s>
WHEN WE THREW IT OPEN TO THE FIELD YEAH </s>
BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE SIDE TO THINK ABOUT MAYBE </s>
MM </s>
OKAY </s>
MM </s>
IT DOES MARK QUITE EASILY TOO IF YOU LET IT FALL </s>
I'VE GOT A MOBILE PHONE MYSELF WHICH IS TITANIUM AND IT DOES MARK VERY EASILY IF YOU DROP IT </s>
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF WE MAKE THE BASIC MOULD OUT OF PLASTIC BUT HAVE LIKE A RUBBER COVER THAT GOES OVER </s>
THAT WOULD GIVE THE SPONGY FEEL THAT ALSO ALLOWS US TO KIND OF HAVE DIFFERENT FASCIAE FOR THE PHONE </s>
LIKE A RUBBER SLEEVE ALMOST YEAH </s>
MM </s>
MM </s>
VERY CHEAP WAY OF CHANGING THE LOOK OF IT AND PEOPLE CAN JUST BUY A NEW ONE IF THEY WANT TO </s>
MM </s>
YEAH </s>
MM </s>
I DON'T S SORRY TO INTERRUPT I DON'T SEE WHY THE CURVED THING IS A PROBLEM </s>
IF WE FOR EXAMPLE HAD A SHELL ONCE WE OPEN THAT YEAH SO IT'D BE F YEAH YEAH </s>
HAVE I MISUNDERSTOOD YOU </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
I JUST HAD ANOTHER IDEA I DON'T KNOW IF IT HELPS WITH THAT BUT JUST TO DO WITH THE R. S. I. </s>
IS IT POSSIBLE JUST AS AN OPTION WHEN WE OPEN IT UP PEOPLE CAN USE THEIR FINGERS TO PRESS THE BUTTON </s>
OR WE HAVE INSIDE LIKE A SMALL POINTER THING WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO </s>
MM </s>
YEAH </s>
THEY'RE EASY TO REPLACE AS WELL CHEAP </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM </s>
YEAH JUST A THOUGHT THEY WOULDN'T ACTUALLY NEED ONE AND THEY COULD USE ANYTHING THEY'VE GOT COULDN'T THEY </s>
A PENCIL OR A PEN SO THEY WOULDN'T REALLY NEED A </s>
MM-HMM </s>
I'LL JUST RAISE ANOTHER POINT WHILE IT OCCURS TO ME IT KIND OF APPLIES TO BOTH OUR DESIGNERS HERE SO I'M NOT SURE HOW IT WOULD FIT IN </s>
IF WE FLIP OPEN </s>
NOW YOU KNOW HOW YOU'VE GOT SOME MIRRORS IN NIGHTCLUBS THAT ARE MIRRORS WHEN YOU TURN TO THEM AND YOU TURN AWAY AND IT GIVES LIKE AN ADVERTISING DISPLAY </s>
YOU SEEN THOSE </s>
AND THEY KIND OF RESPOND TO THE TURN OF YOUR BODY </s>
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WHEN WE OPEN OUR FLIP TOP SHELL IT'S A LITTLE COMPACT MIRROR AND WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON IT THEN GOES ONTO THE PHONE DISPLAY TH UH THE REMOTE CONTROL DISPLAY THING </s>
THEY DON'T LOOK AT THEMSELVES </s>
JUST A THOUGHT </s>
YEAH </s>
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN </s>
IT'S WITH US USING THE IDEAS FOR A MOBILE PH IT'S WITH US USING THE IDEAS FOR MOBILE PHONES I KINDA GOT SIDETRACKED ONTO THAT I THINK </s>
OKAY </s>
TRYING TO THINK OF OTHER FEATURES WE CAN BUILD IN THAT WOULDN'T COST TOO MUCH BUT MAYBE WE'LL LEAVE THAT ONE ON THE SIDE </s>
'KAY </s>
MM </s>
OH I THINK FORGET ABOUT THE MIRROR THAT WAS JUST A VERY QUICK PASSING THOUGHT YEAH </s>
SORRY WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR </s>
OKAY </s>
NO YOU'D HOLD IT YOU DON'T IF YOU FLIP IT OPEN THEN YOU'D BE </s>
WOULDN'T YOU </s>
ISN'T THAT THE IDEA </s>
YOU US IF WE JUST USE THE SHELL AS AN EXAMPLE AGAIN YOU OPEN THAT </s>
YOU'VE GOT YOUR L. C. D. DISPLAY THERE AND YOU'VE GOT THE BUTTONS THERE SO YOU'RE HOLDING IT IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND YEAH </s>

NO </s>
ONE OF THE DECISIONS WE HAD TO MAKE WAS WHETHER WE HAD DOUBLE A. OR TRIPLE A. BATTERIES 'CAUSE THEY'VE STILL GOT TO BE CHARGED THIS WAY HAVEN'T THEY </s>
I OH I SEE </s>
RIGHT OKAY GOT YOU </s>
GOT YOU ON THAT OKAY DIDN'T REALISE </s>
SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THAT LAST PART </s>
L. C. D. SCREEN </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
MM-HMM SO WE DECIDED ON A RUBBER CASING FOR THE PLASTIC SHELL A VARIETY OF DESIGNS OKAY </s>
AND IT IS JUST UH ALTHOUGH IT'S RUBBERISED AND SPONGY APART FROM THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO FOR SORT OF VEGETABLE AND FRUIT COLOURS </s>
WE'RE NOT GONNA TRY AND MAKE IT ACTUALLY A VEGETABLE OR FRUIT DESIGN OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE A SHELL THAT WE DISCUSSED JUST GO FOR THE COLOURS </s>
OKAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
THE FEEL </s>
'KAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
IS THAT GOING TO BE THIS IMAGE I'VE GOT IN MY HEAD OF SOMETHING KIND OF SHAPED LIKE THAT MAYBE ABOUT THAT SIZE </s>
MADE OF PLASTIC FITS INTO THE PALM OF THE HAND RUBBERISED COVER THAT'S SPONGY </s>
IS THAT REALLY GOING TO FIT FANCY LOOK AND FEEL WHICH WAS THE MAJOR THING THAT PEOPLE WANTED MARKET RESEARCH IS THAT FANCY </s>
MM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
I'M JUST KIND OF PUSHING AT THAT TO SEE IF YOU CAME OUT WITH ANYTHING ELSE BUT I MEAN I TOTALLY AGREE </s>
WE LOOKED AT THOSE REMOTES I MEAN THEY ARE KIND OF ANONYMOUS VERY SIMILAR LOOKING THINGS </s>
THIS WOULD DEFINITELY BE DIFFERENT ENOUGH I JUST WONDERED IF ANYBODY COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING EVEN MORE </s>
WELL THE THING IS THE RUBBERISED COVERS ARE GOING TO BE S RELATIVELY CHEAP TO PRODUCE </s>
THAT IF IN A YEAR'S TIME WE WE GET FEEDBACK FROM THE DESIGN FAIRS THAT SHOW SOMETHING ELSE IS COMING I MEAN IT'S SO EASY FOR US TO JUST PRODUCE THAT AND IT CAN BE SLIPPED ON </s>
WHICH IS ANOTHER BEAUTY OF IT </s>
MM SO CAN I JUST RECAP UH SARAH FOR THE DECISIONS THAT WE'VE MADE KINETIC CHARGING THE WATCH TYPE BATTERIES </s>
UM L. C. D. DISPLAY ON TH THE TOP SIDE OF THE FLIP TOP </s>
RUBBERISED BUTTONS ON THE BOTTOM SIDE WE'RE GONNA USE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COLOURS FOR THE RUBBER COVER THE CASE ITSELF IS PLASTIC </s>
THAT'S HOW FAR WE'VE GOT WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE TO ADD TO OUR DECISIONS HERE </s>
MM </s>
YES IT WAS JUST THERE WAS JUST A COST ISSUE WITH THAT </s>
BUT IT'S A GOOD IDEA WE JUST NEED TO CHECK ON THE COST IS THAT RIGHT </s>
AND INCORPORATING THE COMPANY LOGO </s>
MM </s>
'CAUSE I TOOK IT FROM THE FEEDBACK YOU GAVE IN THE LAST MEETING FROM Y FROM Y YOUR REPORT </s>
IT'S NOT JUST A CASE OF HAVING A LITTLE R. R. HIDDEN SOMEWHERE THEY DO WANT IT TO BE OBVIOUS THAT IT'S OUR PRODUCT DON'T THEY </s>
SINCE IT'S THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND ON THE MARKET IT'S OBVIOUSLY GONNA BE OURS </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>

EITHER WE'RE THINKING SOME SOMETHING FAIRLY NEUTRAL LIKE A A WHITE OR A LIGHT BLUE OR SOMETHING </s>
THIS IS UNDERNEATH THE RUBBERISED THE RUBBERISED UH OUTER CASING UM WHICH THERE'D BE SORT OF A WIDE CHOICE THEY WOULD BE ATTACHED </s>
BUT WE CAN WE CAN COME UP WITH THAT </s>
UM THE UM WIDE CHOICE OF COLOURS AND SORT OF PATTERNS SO YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF CUSTOMISATION WITH IT </s>

HOW DO YOU SAY IT'S YEAH YEAH </s>
IT WOULD BE SORT OF INSET INTO THE INTO THE TOP AND THE BUTTONS AT THE BOTTOM WOULD D SO SO IT'LL FULLY CLOSE FLAT </s>
YEAH YEAH </s>
AND WORKING ON THE INSIDE WE'VE UM ALREADY SAID D DECIDED ON THE KINETIC BATTERIES WHICH ACTUALLY </s>
THINKING ABOUT IT NOW COULD Y COULD ALSO PROBABLY ATTACH TO THE FLIPPING OPEN AND SHUT AS WELL SO THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY GET A BIT OF </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
UM WE DECIDED THAT UM THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM </s>
IT DID ACTUALLY SAY ON THE EMAIL THAT THEY WERE SORT OF COMING IN AND THEY WERE FAIRLY EASY TO GET A HOLD OF </s>
SO WE PRESUMED THAT THEY'D ALSO BE QUITE CHEAP </s>
SO YOU'D HAVE SOMETHING LIKE WHERE YOU'D SHOUT OUT WHERE WHERE IS THE REMOTE AND </s>
IT'LL SHOUT BACK I'M HERE OR SOMETHING </s>
AND THEN YEAH </s>
IT WO IT WON'T SHOUT OUT I'M HERE OR SOMETHING </s>
IT'LL JUST SHOUT OUT I'M HERE OR SOMETHING TO SIMILAR EFFECT </s>
UH YEAH IF IT WAS GOING LIKE I D WELL THA THAT COULD BE SOMETHING FOR NEXT TIME MAYBE </s>
YOU CAN HAVE A REMOTE THAT TELLS YOU EXACTLY WHERE IT IS </s>
UM THE STANDARD THERE'S BE A STANDARD TRANSMISSION WITH THE T. V. USING USING ALL THE STANDARD CHIPS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT </s>
UM IT WOULD IT WOULD HAVE OBVIOUSLY 'CAUSE IT'S SPLIT OVER TWO TWO DIFFERENT LAYERS </s>
IT WOULD NEED TWO SEPARATE P. C. B. S SO IT WOULD BE JOINED AT THE HINGE THROUGH SOME SORT OF CABLING </s>
AND UH BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY ALL T. V. S USE THIS THE SAME INFRARED MEDIUM WE'D JUST BE USING USING THE SAME THING TO TRANSMIT THE DATA </s>
AND THE INFRARED </s>
UM SENDER WOULD BE ON THE ON ONE OF THE BOT THE BOTTOM LAYER </s>
JUST AT THE FRONT OF THE WE HAVEN'T I DON'T THINK WE ACTUALLY PUT IT ON </s>
YEAH YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT </s>

SO WHEN YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT IT OPEN IT WOULD BE FACING THE T. V. </s>
AND THEN FINALLY UM ON TO THE INTERFACE </s>
THE TOP SCREEN AS WE SAID IS WOULD BE AN INSET UM BLACK AND WHITE L. C. D. S TOUCH SCREEN WHICH YEAH WOULD </s>
UH HAVE ALL OF ALL OF THE THE AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS FOR FOR THE REMOTE ON IT UH WHEREAS THE BOT THE BOTTOM SCREEN WOULD JUST CONTAIN THE STANDARD BUTTONS </s>
LIKE THE VO VOLUME UP AND DOWN CHANNEL UP AND DOWN POWER ON AND OFF AND UH THINGS TO THAT EFFECT </s>
AND NOW WE'VE WE ALSO DECIDED ON THE INSIDE WE COULD POSSIBLY EITHER HAVE UM SOME SOME KIND OF SORT OF BEZZLED </s>

WELL DONE </s>
CERTAINLY </s>
LOGGED IN </s>
THANK YOU </s>
OOPS </s>
OKAY </s>
THIS STAGE OF THE EVALUATION IS REALLY FOR US AS A TEAM TO EVALUATE IF WE HAVE NOW GOT A PRODUCT SPECIFICATION AND PROTOTYPE DESIGN THAT MEETS THE THE CRITERIA THAT WE GOT FROM OUR MARKET RESEARCH </s>
SO THIS IS THE FIRST STAGE OF THE EVALUATION </s>
NOW THE COLLECTION OF THE CRITERIA AS WE SAW IN OUR PREVIOUS MEETING </s>
WAS BASED ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND TRENDS FOUND IN THE MARKETING REPORTS AND MARKETING STRATEGY OF OUR COMPANY </s>
SO IT'S WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IN THE LAST MEETING ARE WE ACTUALLY MEETING THOSE TRENDS AND REQUIREMENTS </s>
NOW THE FINDINGS THAT WE CAME UP WITH JUST A RECAP ARE HERE </s>
THE CRITERIA THAT WE WANT IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL ARE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE </s>
IT SHOULD INCORPORATE CURRENT FASHION TRENDS AND THOSE THE TWO MAIN ONES THEY WERE THE SPONGY TEXTURE AND THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE STRONG DESIGN COLOURS </s>
THE DESIGN SHOULD MINIMISE R. S. I. AND BE EASY TO LOCATE AND WE WERE STILL UM UH SLIGHTLY AMBIVALENT AS TO WHETHER TO USE VOICE RECOGNITION THERE </s>
THOUGH THAT DID SEEM TO BE THE FAVOURED STRATEGY BUT THERE WAS ALSO ON THE SIDELINE THE THOUGH OF MAYBE HAVING A BEEPER FUNCTION </s>
OKAY SO WE CAN COME BACK TO THAT SLIDE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A NOTE OF THOSE </s>
I'LL JUST SHOW YOU HOW WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE OUR OWN FEEDBACK TO THIS TO WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR </s>
WE'RE GOING TO USE A SEVEN POINT SCALE WHERE ONE IS TRUE AND SEVEN IS FALSE </s>
WE LOOK AT EACH OF THOSE CRITERIA THAT I'VE JUST MENTIONED I'LL CALL THAT SLIDE BACK UP </s>
AND I WILL JUST DO A PRELIMINARY RATING OF ALL THOSE CRITERIA ON THE WHITEBOARD HERE </s>
DOES THAT SEEM CLEAR </s>
ANY QUESTIONS THERE </s>
SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THESE CRITE </s>
YES WE'RE GOING TO COME TO W WE'LL DISCUSS EACH ONE AND WE'LL COME TO A CONSENSUS RATING BETWEEN ONE AND SEVEN </s>
IS THAT OKAY </s>
ONE IS TRUE SEVEN IS FALSE </s>
RIGHT </s>
SO I WON'T WRITE ALL OF THAT OUT AGAIN </s>
IT WILL JUST BE CRITERIA ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX OR A. B. </s>
C. D. E. F. TO CONFUSE IT WITH THE NUMBER RATING </s>
B. C. D. E. F. </s>
THIS IS WHERE I REALISE HOW TINY I ACTUALLY AM </s>
CRITERIA </s>
AND RATING </s>
ACTUALLY IT MIGHT BE AN IDEA IF WE EACH DID GIVE OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL RATING AND WE COULD TAKE AN AVERAGE AT THE END </s>
HOW ABOUT THAT </s>
OKAY </s>
SO I'LL JUST SEPARATE THE RATINGS BY OBLIQUES AND IF WE GO ONE TWO THREE FOUR WE KNOW WHO'S WHO </s>
OKAY </s>
CRITERIA A. THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL </s>
HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT THIS PROTOTYPE MODEL RELATING TO FANCY IT IS A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL </s>
ONE IS TRUE SEVEN IS FALSE </s>
MY OWN RATING FOR THAT WOULD BE A TWO </s>
ONE IS TRUE AND SEVEN IS FALSE </s>
I'LL JUST GO THIS WAY </s>
TWO </s>
OKAY </s>
TWO </s>
A FOUR OKAY </s>
ADDING THOSE UP WE'VE GOT A SIX AND A FIVE ELEVEN DIVIDED BY FOUR IS WHAT </s>
UH TWO AND THREE QUARTERS IT THAT RIGHT </s>
TWO AND THREE QUARTERS </s>
OKAY </s>
TWO POINT SEVEN FIVE THERE WE GO </s>
OKAY CRITERIA B. CRITERION B. TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE </s>
I WOULD GIVE THAT A THREE </s>
OKAY </s>
NOT THAT YOU'RE BIASED IN THAT IT THE DESIGNER </s>
THE AVERAGE OH FOR YOU </s>
YOU WANT YOUR RATING TO BE A TWO </s>
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING </s>
OKAY </s>
SO I'LL WORK OUT THE AVERAGE FOR THAT AGAIN AT THE END </s>
IT'S A VERY SLIGHTLY ALTERED </s>
OKAY AND WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR YOUR RATING F </s>
TWO POINT FIVE OKAY </s>
LOSING ONE DECIMAL PLACE THAT'S OKAY </s>
SO WHAT ARE YOU RATING FOR THIS ONE PAW </s>
TWO OKAY </s>
SO THAT IS EIGHT </s>
THAT BRINGS IT DOWN TO TWO NICE AND SIMPLE YEAH </s>
OKAY EASE OF USE </s>
EASY TO USE </s>
BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SAID THERE I WOULD SAY A ONE TRUE </s>
TWO </s>
A TWO OKAY </s>
TWO </s>
I SHOULD'VE SAID A TWO TO MAKE THE ARITHMETIC EASY SHOULDN'T I </s>
WE'LL JUST PUT ALMOST TWO BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO SILLY DECIMAL PLACES </s>
OKAY </s>
OR WE OR IF WE WANT TO REALLY BRING IT DOWN WE CAN DO LATER </s>
UM MM NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT IT INCORPORATES CURRENT FASHION TRENDS </s>
NOW THAT'S PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO OUR MARKET RESEARCH FINDINGS ABOUT THE SPONGY TEXTURE TO THE EXTERIOR AND THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE DESIGN COLOURS </s>
RIGHT </s>
SO I'M JUST THINKING BEFORE I GIVE IT MY RATING YOU WERE LIMITED IN THE USE OF MATERIALS FOR YOUR PROTOTYPE HERE </s>
IS THIS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE THE COLOURS THAT YOU WOULD USE </s>
RIGHT </s>
SO WE COULD USE ANY STRONG FRUIT AND VEG COLOURS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE INTENDING TO DO </s>
OKAY </s>
AND THE SPONGY FEEL IS NO PROBLEM WITH THAT </s>
OKAY </s>
IN THAT CASE IT'S GOT TO BE A ONE FOR ME </s>
YEP </s>
EVERYBODY </s>
OKAY </s>
THAT PART WAS NICE AND EASY </s>
OKAY </s>
UH MOVING ON TO DOES THE DESIGN MINIMISE REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY </s>
I DON'T THINK WE'VE REALLY TOUCHED ON THAT A LOT </s>
WE'VE WE'VE DISCUSSED IT WE HAVEN'T REALLY COME UP WITH ANYTHING THAT </s>
WE FELT COULD FEASIBLY REDUCE THAT </s>
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT POINTERS BUT THE VERY USE OF A REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO'S ZAPPING </s>
WHO'S SITTING LIKE THAT AND WE FOUND SO MANY PEOPLE DID HOW DO YOU MINIMISE THAT ON SUCH A SMALL DEVICE </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
RIGHT </s>
RIGHT </s>
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO BE NEUTRAL ON THAT AND GIVE IT A FOUR </s>
A FIVE OKAY </s>
FOUR AND A FOUR OKAY </s>
TWENTY ONE IS THAT TWENTY ONE </s>
SO THAT'S FOUR POINT TWO FIVE </s>
AND FINALLY LAST BUT NOT LEAST EASY TO LOCATE </s>
NOW WE TALKED ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION WE TALKED ABOUT A BEEPER HAVE WE REALLY HAVE THE DESIGNERS COME TO ANY DEC REAL DECISION ON THAT </s>
IT WAS THE I'M HERE THING YEP </s>
AND ARE WE HAPPY WITH THE COSTS ON THAT </s>
THAT IS GOING TO BE FEASIBLE COST WISE </s>
THAT SOUNDS GOOD THEN </s>
I'D GO FOR A I CA WE CAN ADJUST THE VOLUME ON THAT JUST AS WE COULD VOLUME ON T. V. </s>
SO IF SOMBODY'S IN THE OTHER ROOM OR IF T. V. S IN DIFFERENT ROOMS OR </s>
RIGHT </s>
OKAY </s>
YOU BUILT INTO THE FEATURE </s>
OKAY </s>
LOGICAL </s>
THAT'S A ONE FOR ME </s>
ONE AND ONE GOOD </s>
SO HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT THIS </s>
WE'VE GOT OUR OUR WE'VE GOT THE HIGHEST RATING OF MEETING THE SPECIFICATIONS THAT IS DEFINITELY TRUE FOR TWO OF THE UH SIX CRITERIA THERE </s>
THAT IS FOR UM INCORPORATES CURRENT FASHION TRENDS AND IS EASY TO LOCATE </s>
THE LOWEST RATING WE'VE GOT WHICH IS REALLY N IT'S NOT TERRIBLY LOW I IT'S CLOSE AROUND NEUTRAL IS FOR UH THE MINIMISATION OF REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY </s>
DO WE FEEL ON THE BASIS OF THA OF THESE EVALUATION FINDINGS THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD AND NOW PRODUCE THIS AS A PROTOTYPE AND MARKET IT </s>
OR DO WE HAVE TO MAKE FURTHER MODIFICATIONS </s>
WE HAPPY TO GO AHEAD </s>
YEAH </s>
I THINK FOR MOST OF THOSE RATINGS THAT IT'S HIGH ENOUGH AT THE UPPER END OF THE SCALE FOR US TO GO AHEAD WITH THAT </s>
AND I REALLY DOUBT IF </s>
ON THE BASIS OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND OUR CURRENT CAPABILITIES WE COULD ACTUALLY DO MUCH MORE TO MINIMISE THAT </s>
I KNOW </s>
OKAY </s>
WELL I HOPE THAT'S UH CLEAR TO THE TEAM </s>
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO TO ASK ME ABOUT THE FINDINGS BEFORE I </s>
SUM UP </s>
GOOD </s>
FINE THEN </s>
I'LL JUST LEAVE IT THERE </s>
OOPS </s>
OH YES </s>
YES </s>
BUT IT HAS A SLIGHTLY FLATTENED BOTTOM SO IT CAN SIT </s>
SO IT CAN REST </s>
IT WOULD JUST BE A FLAT BOTTOM WITH ONE CURVE </s>
LIKE A DOMED THING </s>
MM </s>
THE OTHER CURVES AT THE SIDES BUT IT'S SLIGHTLY FLATTENED AT THE BOTTOM SO IT DOESN'T ROLL OVER </s>
YEAH </s>
WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF YOU PUT POINT FIVE FOR THAT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
RIGHT OKAY </s>
BUT IT IS GONNA BE PART OF THE TOTAL COST AND THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE WE CAN WE CAN PUT THAT IN IS THERE </s>
THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE WE CAN CODE FOR THE THE RUBBER USED IN THE CASING </s>
SO DO WE NOT HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR IT IN THE COST SOMEWHERE THERE </s>

AND PEOPLE ARE USED TO BUYING BATTERIES THEY'RE NOT GONNA SAY I'M NOT GETTING THIS 'CAUSE I'VE GOT TO BUY A BATTERY FOR A REMOTE CONTROL </s>
SHOULD WE SEE WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES </s>
UM </s>
YEAH </s>
SURE </s>

YEAH </s>
MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK OF BRANCHING OUT INTO CHILDREN'S TOYS AND FAKE MOBILE PHONES AS A SIDE LINE </s>

COULD IT'VE BEEN BETTER WAS IT ADEQUATE </s>
MM </s>

I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT THIS HAS BEEN VERY MARKET RESEARCH BASED BECAUSE JUST GOING BACK TO MOBILE PHONES </s>
I MEAN THIS IS THE FIRST CHANGE IN REMOTE CONTROL DEVICES THAT I CAN REALLY YOU KNOW SAY IS IS OBVIOUS AND VISIBLE </s>
WE SEE IT IN MOBILE PHONES A LOT AND THA THAT'S WHERE WE'VE BORROWED A LOT OF OUR IDE OUR IDEAS FROM </s>
THERE ARE INNOVATIONS IN THAT THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY WANT </s>

MM-HMM </s>
BUT I THINK IN THE REMIT THAT WE WERE GIVEN IT WAS VERY SPECIFIC </s>
I THINK WE'VE DONE WHAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO DO </s>
AND I THINK THERE'LL HAVE TO BE ANOTHER PROJECT TEAM OR A NEW PROJECT FOR US TO LOOK AT AT THOSE KIND OF THINGS </s>
I DON'T THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AND FIND A WAY OF RAISING THE CASH FOR </s>
I THINK WE'VE DONE VERY WELL TO GET WITHIN BUDGET AND IT STILL MAKES SUCH AN INNOVATIVE ITEM THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY GONNA WANT </s>

UM </s>
YES Y OPENING ACQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING WELL </s>
THE TOOLS ARE I THINK WE ALREADY I GUESS THE TOOL IS REALLY OUR THE COMPUTER AS FAR AS I CAN SEE </s>
UH WE GET INS EACH OF US WILL GET INSTRUCTIONS AND WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE </s>
PROJECT PLAN THAT FALLS UNDER THE SAME HEADING PRETTY MUCH </s>
UM I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY GREAT DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT </s>
UM </s>
HERE IS WHAT THIS THING SHOULD BE </s>
THIS THING WE ARE GONNA UM UH DESIGN IS A NEW REMOTE CONTROL </s>
UH SHOULD BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND OF COURSE USER FRIENDLY </s>
SO MAYBE YOU WANNA MAKE SOME NOTES OF THAT </s>
OKAY </s>
ALL RIGHT </s>
HERE IS WHAT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IS SUPPOSED TO ACHIEVE </s>
UM </s>
THAT IS IT'S GONNA BE INDIVIDUAL WORK AND THEN AT THE MEETING WE'LL DISCUSS WHAT UH WE HAVE COME UP WITH </s>
THE SAME GOES FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN THERE WILL BE INDIVIDUAL WORK WHIC AND THEN DISCUSSION AFTERWARDS </s>
DETAILED DESIGN SAME THING BASICALLY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
I CAN'T WRITE WITH THIS THING </s>
YES </s>
YEAH OKAY </s>
ALL RIGHT </s>
THEN TOOL TRAINING TRY OUT THE WHITE BOARD PARTICIPANT CAN DRAW THEIR FAVOURITE ANIMAL </s>
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO GO AND SEE HOW THE WHITE BOARD WORKS </s>
SO THAT IN CASE WE HAVE TO IN THE NEXT MEETING PRESENT SOMETHING ON THE WHITE BOARD </s>
YOU WANNA GO EILEEN AND </s>
WHETHER YOU WITHOUT HANGING YOURSELF </s>

NO NO </s>
NO THAT'S OKAY </s>
I DON'T KNOW WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
HERE'S THE PROJECT FINANCE UH WHICH OF COURSE WE ALL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WE DESIGN THIS THING </s>
UM SELLING PRICE IS SUPPOSED TO BE TWENTY FIVE EURO </s>
UH PROFIT AIM FOR THE COMPANY IS FIFTY MILLION EURO THE MARKET RANGE UNLIMITED MEANING INTERNATIONAL </s>
AND THE PRODUCTION COST SHOULD NOT EXCEED HOPEFULLY SHOULD BE LESS THAN TWELVE FIFTY EURO </s>
MM-HMM </s>
SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS OF COURSE TO REMEMBER WITH THE BUDGET AND WHEN YOU DESIGN TO MATERIALS COST ETCETERA </s>
NOW UH THE DISCUSSION I GUESS IS UM DOES ANYONE OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE CONTROL </s>
I EXP I S 'CAUSE WE WE USE 'EM WE USE 'EM RIGHT EVERYDAY </s>
AND UM </s>
NOW HAVING USED A REMOTE CONTROL FOR YEARS DOES ANYBODY ALREADY HAVE LIKE AN IDEA LIKE THINGS YOU DIDN'T LIKE WITH IT </s>
THINGS YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THINGS YOU WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE WITH THIS THING YE ANY FIRST IDEAS </s>
WOULD YOU LIKE IT TO BE SMALLER BIGGER HAVE MORE HAVE MORE BUTTONS ON IT OR MAYBE CLEARLY BETTER MARKED BUTTONS YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT </s>
SMALL RIGHT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
SO IT SHOULD BE A MULTI FUNCTIONAL UH GADGET THAT WOULD UM CONTROL ALL YOUR HOUSEHOLD UH UH MACHINES BASICALLY </s>
WELL </s>
IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING NEW IT SHOULD BE S IT IT SHOULD DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THAN JUST WHAT WE HAVE </s>
NOW OF COURSE THE OTHER THING TO THINK THERE IS MAYBE THE DESIGN </s>
LIKE TRENDY NO LIKE F FOR EARLIER WE SAW MAYBE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING TRENDY YOU KNOW </s>
MAYBE IT SHOULD DIFFERENT COLOURS OR MATERIALS OR YOU KNOW </s>
UM SO YEAH SHAPES RIGHT YOU KNOW LIKE KIDNEY SHAPE FEELS BETTER IN YOUR HAND OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW </s>
YEAH </s>
YES </s>
THAT IS TRUE BECAUSE THEY PUT A NEWSPAPER OR THEY PUT IT BEHIND A PLANT OR WE YOU KNOW WHATEVER </s>
AND AND THEY SUDDENLY THE PHONE RINGS AND THEY WANT TO TURN THE T. V. OFF AND THEY SAY WHERE THE HELL IS MY MY REMOTE CONTROL YEAH </s>
WELL OR YEAH OR IF IT'S REALLY IF IT'S REALLY IN A DARK SPOT THAT IT GIVES OUT A A SOUND OR A SIGNAL </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
SO IF LOST </s>
IF LOST UH SIGNAL WITH B THROW SIGNAL YOU KNOW </s>
EXACTLY I MEAN JUST THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING </s>
I'M JUST SAYING THROW SIGNAL MEANING JUST WHETHER IT'S A BEEP OR WHETHER A LIGHT OR </s>
OKAY MY MY IDEA IS MAYBE THAT THE MINUTE IT'S REALLY HIDDEN </s>
IN IN OTHER WORDS IF IT'S LIKE IN A DARK SPOT UH MEANING YOU KNOW LIKE A NEWSPAPER IS ON TOP </s>
A SWEATER IS ON TOP OR IT IT'S BEHIND A PLANT </s>
AT THAT MOMENT IT'S IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE UM WHAT YOU CALL IT A LIGHT S SENSORS YOU KNOW </s>
IN IN THAT MOMENT IT HAS A SENSOR I IT IT GETS A CERTAIN DARKNESS </s>
IT GE HAS A SENSOR AND IT GIVES OUT A SIGNAL WHETHER THAT BE A LIGHT SIGNAL OR A BEEP </s>
I MEAN THAT WE CAN DISCUSS THAT LATER YOU KNOW </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE RIGHT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF SENSOR AND I I THINK UH VOICE OR CLAPPING IT'S NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH </s>
UH I KNOW THERE ARE THE LAMPS AND STUFF YOU KNOW YOU CAN CLAP ON AND OFF BUT I THINK THEY ONLY WORK TO CERTAIN DEGREE AND </s>
WHAT WITH </s>
OH YEAH WELL BUT THEN THOSE PEOPLE WE CAN'T HELP EVERYBODY </s>
OKAY WE HAVE UH YEAH WE HAVE TO MOVE ALONG BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME GOOD GOOD POINTS TO START WITH HERE </s>

MY NAME IS EILEEN </s>
OKAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
NO </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM 'KAY SO </s>
THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DESIGN THAT WE'RE GONNA BE CONCERNED WITH OKAY </s>
FUNCTIONAL CONCEPTION </s>
AND DETAILED </s>
MAYBE WE SHOULD REDESIGN IT </s>
AFTER WE'VE FINISHED THE REMOTE CONTROL WE'LL GET TO THAT </s>
OKAY I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO </s>
SEE IF I R </s>
SEE IF I REMEMBER HOW TO DRAW A KITTY CAT OR A RABBIT OR SOMETHING </s>
SO THAT IT WILL RECORD OKAY </s>
UM UH UM TRADITIONAL KITTY CAT </s>
I'VE A VERY FAT CAT </s>
AND IT LIKES TO SIT LIKE THAT </s>
OKAY </s>
AM I SUPPOSED TO WIPE OFF THAT OR OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
UH OKAY </s>
I HOPE THE KITTY CAT IS HUNGRY 'CAUSE I DON'T LIKE SNAKES </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
MM 'KAY THAT SHOULD KEEP EVERYBODY ON THEIR TOES AND CHALLENGED </s>
PROFIT </s>
UM IS FIFTY MM </s>
OOPS </s>
AT UM TWELVE FIFTY EUROS PER </s>
WELL WHO KNOWS IF WE GET A REALLY GOOD DESIGNER MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT </s>
WE CERTAINLY CAN TRY TO I AGREE WITH HER THAT TO MARKET SOMETHING SUCCESSFULLY IT SHOULD DO SOME MORE THINGS </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
YEAH OKAY FRIENDLY SHAPE THAT WOULD HELP </s>
I THINK ANOTHER THING THAT WOULD HELP IS UM IF IT BEEPS WHEN YOU CLAP BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE LOSE THEM </s>
THEY CAN'T FIND IT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
SO SOME </s>
UH SO SO IT'S REALLY THE BEEP OR OR A LIGHT SHOULD BLINK </s>
MM 'KAY </s>
AND DO YOU THINK A GOOD C C UM CLUE FOR THAT IS THAT IT WOULD RESPOND TO A CLAP OR IT WOULD RESPOND TO YOUR VOICE OR IT WOULD RESPOND WHAT WHAT SHOULD YOU HAVE TO DO TO MAKE IT BEEP OR BLINK </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY SO </s>
OKAY </s>
SO THE LIGHT SENSOR WOULD ACTIVATE THE SIGNAL </s>
MM-HMM </s>
BUT IT COULD BE SOMEPLACE REALLY OBVIOUS AND YOU STILL WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FIND IT </s>
WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE S BECAUSE YOU'RE SILLY </s>
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SILLY </s>
I MEAN IT COULD BE ON WELL I IF IT WERE LIKE ON TOP OF YOUR BOOKCASE AND YOU USUALLY KEPT IT ON THE COFFEE TABLE UM </s>
YOU KNOW WELL MAYBE WE HAVE TO MOVE ALONG OKAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
WE HAVE TO JUSTIFY THAT PRICE BY HAVING SUFFICIENT FEATURES TO MAKE IT SELL AT THAT PRICE </s>
MM </s>
OKAY I THINK I HAVE ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT 'TIL OUR NEXT MEETING </s>
HOW ABOUT YOU PEOPLE </s>
REALLY </s>
OKAY </s>
'KAY </s>
ALRIGHT WELL UH </s>
OKAY VERY GOOD </s>

OKAY AND NOW I CAN UH FULL SCREEN </s>
UH OKAY OKAY </s>
UH OKAY CAN CAN I AT THIS POINT INTERJECT UM SOMETHING </s>
UM WE HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTION FROM HIGHER UP THAT CERTAIN THINGS SHOULD NOT BE UH CONSIDERED </s>
UM THE ONE THING FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING TO ELIMINATE MAYBE THAT'S THE TELETEXT BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF OUTDATED WITH THE INTERNET </s>
AND ACCORDING TO TO HIGHER MANAGEMENT THE IT SHOULD ONLY CONTROL THE T. V. </s>
MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT IT'S TOO COMP COMPLEX A TASK TO UM TO TO INCLUDE OTHER THINGS AND THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH THE TIME TO MARKET </s>
OKAY </s>
UM AND THE AND THE THIRD THING THAT THEY WANNA MAKE SURE UM THAT THEIR THAT THE CORPORATE IMAGE IS BEING MAINTAINED </s>
AND THAT THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND DESIGN ARE BEING USED ON THE PRODUCT </s>
SO THAT IT'S EASY THAT THAT THAT THEY CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED AS A PRODUCT OF OF OF THE COMPANY </s>
AND THAT THERE'S NO MISTAKE THAT IT COULD BE SOMEBODY ELSE WHO IS BRINGING THIS OUT </s>
SO I JUST WANTED TO INTERJECT THIS HERE SO WE'RE NOT GETTING TOO MUCH OFF TRACK HERE WITH UH WITH THE THINGS WE WANNA LOOK AT </s>
THESE WERE INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIGHER UP SO WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE UH THESE THINGS SO IT'S ONLY GONNA BE T. V. </s>
BUT THE ONE THING MAYBE THAT COULD BE UM ELIMINATED IS THE TELETEXT UH IDEA </s>

AS THE BUDGET WE'RE LOOKING AT IF YOU BUILD ONE MOULD I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT'S GONNA BE SQUARE OR </s>

UH OKAY NOW I HAVE </s>
ON MY SLIDE SHOW BASICALLY WE ALREADY WE HAVE ALREADY DONE THE AGENDA AND UH ON THE CLOSING UH BASICALLY THERE WILL BE LUNCH BREAK AND ALL THAT </s>
HOWEVER UH THE DECISION WE HAVE TO TAKE IN THIS MEETING IS WHO IS OUR TARGET GROUP </s>
AND UH WHAT FUNCTION WORKING DESIGN HOW HOW DOES IT WORK </s>
SO THESE ARE THE TWO THINGS WE SHOULD COME UP WIT WITH </s>
SO UH THE FIRST THING IS PRO MAYBE A LITTLE EASIER ON UH WHO IS OUR TARGET GROUP </s>
UM </s>
I GUESS IN MANY WAYS EVERYBODY </s>
EVERYBODY WHO HAS A T. V. </s>
YEAH AND I THINK TODAY THERE ARE PROBABLY NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A T. V. </s>
THERE ARE A FEW BUT IN GENERAL NOT </s>
NOW TALKING ABOUT THE TARGET GROUP WHICH IS IN A SENSE EVERYBODY BUT I THINK WITHIN THE TARGET GROUP WE HAVE SUBGROUPS </s>
WE HAVE WE HAVE EARLIER IT WAS MENTIONED ABOUT UM FOR EXAMPLE ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIMITED FUNCTION WITH THEIR FINGERS AND HANDS </s>
SO I THINK THAT'S UH ONE GROUP THAT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT </s>
UM THEN WE HAVE JUST THE NERVOUS PEOPLE WHO CAN NEVER PRESS A LITTLE BUTTON ON ANYTHING UM UNLESS IT'S REALLY VERY CLEAR </s>
AND UH I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE WANT TO CATER TO CHILDREN'S USE </s>
I MEAN THAT'S A QUESTION UM WHETHER THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT CHILDREN CAN REALLY USE IT OR NOT </s>
SO THIS THESE ARE JUST SOME THOUGHTS I HAVE ON IT </s>
AND UM I DUNNO WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN JUST SAY WE HAVE ONE TARGET GROUP AND FOR THIS ONE TARGET GROUP WE'RE GONNA DESIGN THIS ONE THING OR WHETHER WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT WE LIKE WE WE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT SHAPES </s>
WHETHER THAT DIFFERENT SHAPE ALSO INCLUDES MAYBE DIFFERENT UH BUTTONS UH FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS </s>
MM-HMM </s>
THAT HAS A LOT OF THAT HAS A LOT OF APPEAL BUT I THINK UH I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FUNCTIONALITY NOW ON IT WHETHER WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT GROUPS </s>
I THINK THE CHILDREN ISSUE CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH THE SHAPE AND WITH COLOURS </s>
YOU KNOW LIKE YOU MAKE IT NICE AND PINK FLUORESCENT BANANA COLOUR OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW YEAH FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW </s>
BUT THE QUESTION IS REALLY WHO IS OUR TARGET GROUP </s>
DO WE LOOK AT ONE TARGET GROUP </s>
AND WITH THE TWENTY FIVE EUROS YOU KNOW CAN WE CAN WE AFFORD TO HAVE UH I'M ASKING THE TECHNICAL PEOPLE HERE WHETHER UM TO LOOK AT </s>
SORT OF SUBGROUPS WITH MAYBE DIFFERENT BUTTONS FOR EACH GROUP HOW MUCH WOULD THAT THROW US </s>
OUT OF THE COST WE ARE SUPPOSED TO RESPECT </s>
RIGHT </s>
WITH WITH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
WELL THAT'S THAT'S </s>
YEAH </s>
NO </s>
THE THE QUEST THE QUESTION TO BE ADDRESSED HERE IS ONLY WHO IS THE TARGET GROUP AND HOW WILL IT FUNCTION </s>
AND I THINK THE HOW WILL IT FUNCTION IS PROBABLY THE QUESTION OF THE BUTTONS YOU KNOW WITHIN THE TARGET GROUP OR SUBGROUPS </s>
THE QUESTION IS ONLY WHETHER OUR BUDGET WILL ALLOW TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE DESIGN IN A SENSE </s>
I MEAN THE BASIC DESIGN I UNDERSTAND WILL BE THE SAME </s>
BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH WILL THAT SET US BACK IF LET'S SAY UH FORTY PERCENT WE MAKE LARGE BUTTONS AND THE REST WE MAKE REGULAR BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE </s>
SO THAT REMAINS TO S TO BE SEEN BUT UH THE TARGET GROUP AS A WHOLE IS IS BASICALLY EVERYBODY WITH A T. V. </s>
YEAH WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION </s>
WELL MAYBE THERE'S THERE'S AN IDEA YOU KNOW T THE NEW FOR EXAMPLE NEW PORTABLE PHONES </s>
THEY HAVE LIKE REMOVABLE PLASTIC CASES </s>
SO YOU CAN HAVE A STRIPED ONE OR YOU CAN HAVE A FLUORESCENT BLUE ONE OR WHATEVER AND MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT </s>
THAT IN EACH PACKAGE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOU YOU HAVE YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE UH YOU HAVE LET'S SAY A FLUORESCENT BLUE ON IT BUT THEN YOU HAVE UH ANOTHER COLOUR OR STRIPE WHATEVER THAT ALREADY COMES IN A PACKAGE </s>
AND THEN IF PEOPLE REALLY WANT MORE COLOURS THEY CAN BUY IT SEPARATELY </s>
YOU KNOW YES </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
AND BUT LIKE IF IF THEN EVERYBODY IS IS IS TIRED OF THE FLUORESCENT BLUE AND OF THE STRIPED OR WHATEVER THEY HAVE AS ANOTHER ONE IN THE PACKAGE </s>
THEN THEY CAN GO TO THE STORE AND FOR A FEW UH FRANCS OR EUROS WHATEVER THEY CAN BUY AN ALTERNATE PACKAGE WITH ANOTHER TWO COLOURS IN IT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW </s>
WELL I THINK I THINK THE IDEA HERE IS TO UH TO TO D DESIGN ONE REMOTE AND WHAT THE ONLY CHANGE IS GONNA BE UM THE FUNCT D T YEAH UH THE FUNCTIONAL FUNCTIONAL COSMETICS IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT WAY </s>
UM HAVING MAYBE LARGER BUTTONS OR BUTTONS THAT LIGHT UP OR BUTTONS THAT ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY SHAPED FOR PEOPLE UH EITHER FOR CHILDREN UM </s>
FIVE MINUTES THAT WAS I GUESS THA THAT'S THE OLD MESSAGE </s>
FINISH MEETING NOW </s>
UM UM </s>
BUT I THINK I I THINK TO SUM IT UP THE TARGET GROUP IS BASICALLY EVERYBODY </s>
IF MONEY PERMITS WE CAN ADDRESS SOME FEATURES FOR SOME SUBGROUPS WITHIN THAT </s>
DO WE AGREE DO WE </s>
DO WE AGREE ON ON THAT IN PRINCIPLE LIKE MONEY WILL TELL WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT OR NOT </s>
OKAY </s>
SO NOW I UNDERSTAND IT'S LUNCH BREAK </s>
AND UM </s>
SO THAT'S WHAT WE WILL DO </s>

PARTICIPANT TWO </s>
YES </s>
NO NO I'M THREE </s>
I CAN MAKE IT FULL </s>
YES YES YES </s>
OKAY </s>
AS UH USER INTERFACE DESIGNER I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH TO FIND OUT WHAT ARE THE FEATURES WHICH A USER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ON THEIR REMOTE </s>
YEAH CAN YOU PLEASE GO ONTO THE NEXT SLIDE </s>
SO I FOUND OUT THAT UH BUT UH THE MAIN PURPOSE OF A REMOTE IS TO UH F CONTROL THE FUNCTION OF A TELEVISION AT A FAR OFF DISTANCE AT REMOTE DISTANCE </s>
NOW FOR THAT </s>
UH A REMOTE CONTROLLER SHOULD HAVE A SWITCH ON OFF BUTTON BY WHICH A USER CAN SIT ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM IN FRONT OF THE T. V. AND HE CAN CONTROL THE FUNCTIONALITIES DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE T. V. </s>
THERE SHOULD BE A SIGNAL UH SOMETHING LIKE A RADIO WAVE OR A INFRARED LIGHT OR A LED WHICH CAN BE USED TO CHANGE THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES IN THE TELEVISION IF THE USER WANTS TO UH CHANGE THE CHANNELS OR INCREASE THE VOLUME HE CAN CHANGE IT </s>
NOW THERE SHOULD BE SOME TIMER TO SET FOR VIEWING A PARTICULAR A PARTICULAR PROGRAMME OR SWITCHING ON AND OFF A UH A PARTICULAR PROGRAMME ACCORDING TO THE USER CHOICE </s>
YES </s>
YES </s>
SO IF IF HE WANT TO VIEW A PARTICULAR PROGRAMME AT SAY NINE O'CLOCK HE CAN SET THE TIME </s>
AND THE T. V. WILL AUTOMATICALLY IT WILL SWITCH ON AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME </s>
SO HE CAN USE THAT KIND OF UH UH PROPERTIES OF FEATURES AND THEN THERE SHOULD BE A CHILD LOCK SYSTEM IF A PARTICULAR CHANNEL IS NOT TO BE VIEWED BY A PARTICULAR UH FOR A CERTAIN AGE </s>
THEN THE PARENTS CAN LOCK THAT PARTICULAR CHANNEL SO THAT THE CH CHILDREN CANNOT VIEW THAT CHANNEL </s>
AND UH THE UH THE UH AND THE ONE OF THE FEATURE A USER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IS THE COMPACTNESS OF THE CO REMOTE </s>
UH T THE REMOTE SHOULD BE COMPACT AND IT SHOULD HA IT SHOULD HAVE AS MANY BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE T. V. TELEVISION </s>
AND UM UH AS UH UH THIS IS MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE THAT IT SHOULD BE IN THE SHAPE OF A T. IN ALPHABET FOR MORE COMPACTABILITY </s>
AND UH AND UH AND IT IS ONE MORE POINT WHICH I NOTED IT DOWN </s>
LIKE UH THE MATERIAL WHICH WHICH WHICH IS USED FOR REMOTES SHOULD BE HUMAN FRIENDLY IT SHOULD NOT CAUSE ANY SKIN DISEASE OR SOMETHING SOME AL ALLERGY TO EITHER CHILDREN OR TO UM AD ADULT PERSON </s>
AND IT SHOULD HAVE AN UH IT CAN HAVE AN ALARM CLOCK A A PERSON IF SOME IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GET UP AT AROUND EIGHT EIGHT P. M. THEN HE CAN SET THE TIME AND IT CAN BE USED AS AN ALARM CLOCK </s>
AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL COST MUCH TO SET AN ALARM CLOCK INSIDE A REMOTE </s>
YES AND AS JOHN REECE SAID THE BUTTONS CAN BE </s>
UH CAN ME WE CAN USE THE FLUORESCENCE TO LIGHT UP THE BUTTONS SO DIFFERENT UH BUTTONS WILL GLOW DIFFERENTLY </s>
SO IN EVEN IN THE DARK THE USER CAN KNOW WHAT BUTTONS TO USE TO SWITCH ON A PARTICULAR CHANNEL </s>
AND UH UH THE DESIGN OF THE UH UM REMOTE SHOULD BE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY SHARP PROJECTIONS SO THAT IF A CHILD PLAYS WITH A REMOTE </s>
HE UH HE SHOULD NOT BE HARMED IN ANY WAY </s>
AND FINDINGS UH I FOUND OUT UH Y UM ON DIFFERENT SITES THAT UH THERE ARE DIFFERENT REMOTES WHICH CAN BE USED </s>
THERE ARE REMOTES WHICH USE THE INFRARED FOR CONTROLLING THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES THERE ARE REMOTES WHICH USE THE RADIO WAVES TO CONTROL THE FUNCTIONS AND THERE ARE UH </s>
SO UH THERE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT UH TYPES OF REMOTES FOR DIFFERENT LIGHT SOURCE WHICH ARE USED WHICH CAN BE USED FOR CONTROLLING THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES OF A TELEVISION </s>
NEXT SLIDE </s>
AND THESE ARE MY FEW PERSONAL PREFERENCES LIKE IT CAN BE USED FOR A MULTIPURPOSE USE </s>
NOT </s>
UH NO UH LIKE IT CAN IT CAN BE USED AS A T. V. CONTROL AS PLUS AN ALARM CLOCK TO SET AN ALARM A TIMING AND IT SHOULD HAVE A CHILD LOCK </s>
AND THEN TO SAVE ELECTRICITY UH THERE SHOULD NOT BE UH MUCH S MOVE UH LOTS OF CIRCUITS AND ALL THAT </s>
AND IF A PERSON IF IF IF PARENTS WANTS THE TELEVISION TO BE SWITCHED OFF BY TEN O'CLOCK THEN IT SHOULD BE SWITCHED OFF TEN O AT TEN O'CLOCK AUTOMATICALLY </s>
SO THAT NOBODY ELSE COMES LATER AND USE IT </s>

YEAH AND THEN YOU CAN USE A TIMER AS WELL </s>
YES </s>
YEAH THAT'S IT </s>

MM-HMM </s>

NO UH GENERALLY WE CAN WE CAN DESIGN A REMOTE WHICH IS MAINLY FOR PEOPLE WITH UH F AGE FROM TEN TO UM FORTY AND AND THEN WE CAN ADD ON UH SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS THE ELDERLY PEOPLE OR THE PEOPLE WIT WITH WHO HAVE NERVOUS PROBLEMS </s>
YES </s>
BUT IN A FAMILY IN A FAMILY THERE WILL BE A AGED PERSON CHILDREN AND A MIDDLE AGED BUT THEY CANNOT BUY THREE DIFFERENT REMOTES </s>

THE CUP CUP SHAPE HERE </s>
THE THIR THIRD </s>
YEAH EXACTLY </s>
UH SO TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER </s>
UM CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLI SLIDE PLEASE </s>
THE METAL IS LIKE UH IN A REMOTE CONTROLLER YOU HAVE A CHIP INTEGRATED CIRCUIT WHICH IS LIKE A BRAIN OF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER </s>
IT TAKES THE POWER FROM A BATTERY SAY A BATTERY IT IT CAN BE A ELEC AN ELECTRIC SUPPLY LIKE YOU HAVE TO UH LIKE UH SWITCH CONNEC CONNECT CONNECT YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER TO UH POWER SUPPLY FROM THE YOU KNOW ELECTRICITY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT </s>
IT SHOULD BE A BATTERY BECAUSE UH UH REMOTE CONTROLLER SHOULD BE LIKE YOU YOU YOU SHOULD TAKE IT T TO WHEREVER YOU WANT AND THEN UM UH TH THIS INTEGRATED CIRCUITRY TAKES ENERGY FROM THE POWER SOURCE AND WHATEVER LIKE IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON IT'S LIKE A INPUT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND IT TAKES THE INPUT AND IT IT TRANSFORMS INTO A INFRO INFRARED BITS AND IT SENDS IT INTO THE DEVICE </s>
LIKE A T. V. OR A AIR CONDITIONER SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO </s>
UH A REMOTE CONTROLLER IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO A SINGLE DEVICE </s>
IF YOU WANT TO DESIGN IT FOR MULTIPLE DEVICES THEN YOU SHOULD MAKE ALL THE DEVICES COMPATIBLE WITH THE FREQUENCY LIKE UH TH THE REMOTE CONTROLLER IT SENDS SOME BITS SOME UH WAVES LIKE WITH A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY THE DEVICE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE FREQUENCY IS </s>
IT SHOULD RE RE RECOGNISE THE UH WAVES WHICH ARE COMING FROM THE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND IT SHOULD TAKE THE ACTION LIKE IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON CHANNEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEN UH THE REMOTE UH REMOTE CONTROLLER WILL SEND A SEND A SE SEND A SIGNAL </s>
AND THE T. V. IT SHOULD TRANSLATE THAT INTO LIKE CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT </s>
CHANGE THE VOLUME CONTROL AND UH SO UH I THINK IT'S HARD TO DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROLLER FOR MULTIPLE UH DEVICES </s>
UH YEAH </s>
UM </s>
SO UH USER INTERFACE CONTROLS THE CHIP AND ACCORDINGLY THE MESSAGES LIKE THERE SHOULD BE A USER USER IN INTERFACE LIKE YOU KNOW SWITCH PAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUTTONS SHOULD BE THERE </s>
SO UH YOU CAN CONTROL WHATEVER YOU WANT </s>
YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL YOU WANT TO CONTROL THE VOLUME YOU YOU WANT TO UH MUTE UH MUTE THE UH T. V. OR YOU WANT TO HAVE A CHILD LOCK OR YOU WANT TO DO SOME OPERATIONS THERE'S A THERE SHOULD BE SOME DEVICE TO TELL WHAT TO DO TO THE UH IN UH INTEGRATED CIRCUIT SO THAT THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CAN S SEND THE SIGNALS AND T. V. CAN PERFORM THE ACTIONS </s>
SO CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
SO I I JUST WOULD LIKE TO UH ADD SOME EXTRA FEATURES TO THE REMOTE CONTROLLER UM I THINK THESE ARE THE VERY SIMPLE FEATURES AND UH THEY DON'T TAKE MUCH UH UH MUCH OF THE UM UM INVESTMENT ALSO </s>
IT'S LIKE EL THE TEXT OR BUTTONS WHICH UH WHICH ARE THERE ON THE UH REMOTE CONTROLLER THEY THOSE WE CAN MAKE UH UM LIKE FLUORESCENT UH THEY'LL BE LIKE LIGHT EMITTING IF IT IS DARK SO THAT YOU CAN FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER IF IT IS DARK </s>
AND THER THERE SHOULD BE A BEEP IF MANY BUTTONS ARE PRESSED IF SUPPOSE A CHILD IS PLAYING WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND A AND SHE SHE OR HE IS PRESSING THE BUTTONS ALL AT THE TIME THEN THERE SHOULD BE A BEEP SAYING THAT IT'S THIS THIS IS NOT A A YOU KNOW A A ACTION </s>
THERE CAN BE NO ACTION TAKING TO THAT SO </s>
AND THERE SHOULD BE A CHILD LOCK </s>
LIKE UH UH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOCK YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER SO THAT UH UM WHATEVER BUTTONS ARE PRESSED BY A CHILD THEY CAN'T BE LIKE Y YOU I YOU IF YOU HAVE KI KIDS AND ALL THEN THEY'LL BE PL PLAYING WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLLERS SO CAN LOCK THE REMOTE CONTROLLER </s>
IF MAKE IT USEABLE FOR MORE THAN ONE DEVICE IT'S A IT'S HARD BUT I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT UH YEAH YEAH YEAH SO IT'S IT'S OKAY </s>
YEAH YEAH </s>
AND UH DIFFERENT SHAPES THAT WE CAN DO LIKE UH WE CAN HAVE YOU KNOW A ALL ANIMALS SHAPES OR YOU KNOW COMFORTABLE UH WHI WHICH CAN FIT INTO YOUR HANDS AND UM SO THAT UH </s>
YEAH YEAH YEAH AND COLOURS ALSO DIFFERENT COLOURS AND </s>
NO NO NO IT WON'T UH I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE LIKE YOU CAN HAVE YOU KNOW FOR UH IF YOU WANT THER THERE TO BE MORE </s>
YEAH YEAH </s>
IT'S IT'S JUST A S SHAPE SO IT DOESN'T MATTER </s>

YEAH THAT IS ALSO POSSIBLE I UH YEAH I I YEAH </s>
YEAH THAT WILL BE </s>
YEAH YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH FOR CHILDREN YEAH EXACTLY </s>
YEAH THAT'S WHAT YEAH </s>
YEAH EXACTLY </s>
YEAH </s>
AND AND THE BUTTO BUTTONS ALSO I THINK IF YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE FEATURES IN YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER THEN THERE SHOULD BE MORE BUTTONS </s>
IF THERE ARE MORE BUTTONS THEN IT WILL BE MORE COMPLICATED </s>
IF YOU HAVE LESS FEATURES THEN YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER WON'T BE ATTRACTIVE </s>
SO I THINK UH WE NEED TO MAKE SOME BUTTONS WHICH ARE WHICH ARE LIKE UM UH F IN UH IN INTENDED FOR TWO OR THREE OPERATIONS </s>
LIKE IF YOU PRESS ONE BUTTON IN ONE MODE THEN IT WILL CHANGE THE CHANNEL IF YOU PRESS THE OTHER BUTTON IN ANOTHER MODE IT WILL CHANGE THE COLOUR </s>
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE LESS BUTTONS WE CAN HAVE THAT OPTION BUT I THINK IT WILL COMPLICATE THE MATTER MORE I THINK SO </s>

SO YEAH </s>
AND UH DISPLAY CLOCK I IF YOU WANT MORE FEATURES THEN WE CAN DISPLAY A CLOCK IT I I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE ANY MONEY EXTRA MONEY BECAUSE ANYWAY WE HAVE AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT I THINK WE CAN JUST DEFINITELY FIT THAT FEATURE INTO THE CIRCUIT SO IT'S </s>
YEAH AND WE DISPLAY A CLOCK </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SEE YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER YEAH YEAH YEAH SO </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
UH CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
UH COMPONENTS UH THE MAIN COMPONENTS WE NEED FOR UH IT HA LIKE BUTTONS AND UH UNDERNEATH THAT THERE SHOULD BE SWITCH </s>
AND UH BULBS </s>
LIKE UH WE CAN HAVE A BULB LIKE WHENEVER WE ARE OPERATING A REMOTE CONTROLLER OR UH WHENEVER THE T. V. IS ON SUPPOSE </s>
THEN THE REMOTE CONTROLLER SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY HAVE A B S LIGHT </s>
THEN IT WILL BE LIKE IF YOU SWITCH ON YOUR T. V. THROUGH ANOTH ANOTHER SOURCE </s>
NOT FROM THROUGH A REMOTE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND YOU YOU LOST YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER MAYBE YOU CAN FIND WITH THE LIGHT </s>
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE THAT </s>
WHENEVER THE T. V. IS ON REMOTE CONTROLLER WILL HAVE A LIGHT </s>
AND THEN UH INFRARED BULBS </s>
UM THIS IS LIKE UH WHEN IT IS DARK </s>
AND BATTERY THERE SHOULD BE A BATTERY FOR POWER SUPPLY AND A CHIP </s>
CHIP WHICH IS LIKE A BRAIN TO THE REMOTE CONTROLLER WHICH DOES ALL THE OPERATIONS </s>
AND WIRES CONNECTING ALL CHIPS WHICH IS UH LIGHTS EVERYTHING SO THERE SHOULD BE WIRES </s>
AND UH UH OF COURSE THERE SHOULD BE A CASE WHERE WE CAN KEEP ALL THE THINGS AND </s>
YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SHAPES OR WHATEVER IT IS THERE SHOULD BE A CASE TO PUT TO GIVE A SHAPE </s>
YEAH </s>

WE CAN DESIGN DIFFERENT REMOTES FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE LIKE FOR AGED PEOPLE THERE WILL BE BIG BUTTONS AND YOU KNOW </s>
YEAH </s>
CHILDREN AND EVERYBODY YEAH </s>
YEAH OF COURSE THAT WE CAN DO </s>
BUT SPECIFICALLY IF Y IF LIKE ELDERLY PEOPLE WANT BIG BUTTONS THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY MAKE A BI BIG REMOTE CONTROLLER SO MAYBE SPECIFICALLY YOU CAN DESIGN A BIG CON REMOTE CONTROLLER FOR ELDERLY AND FOR CHILDREN </s>

NO IT IT DOESN'T COST YEAH </s>

YEAH YEAH OF COURSE YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
THANK YOU </s>
YEAH I'D TO JUST PUT ON MY MICROPHONE HERE AND I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY YOU WANT ME TO START RIGHT NOW </s>
OKAY </s>
WELL COULD YOU UM PUT MY SLIDES UP 'CAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IF UH WE LOOKED AT THE SLIDES AT THE SAME TIME </s>
I'M PARTICIPANT FOUR I BELIEVE </s>
YES UH-HUH </s>
'KAY </s>
THERE WE GO </s>
OKAY WELL I THINK WE HAVE INTRODUCED OURSELVES SO THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ARE IS IS PART OF MY GOAL BUT WHY DON'T WE PASS RIGHT TO THE SECOND SLIDE </s>
CAUSE THAT'S WHERE M MY DISCUSSION STARTS </s>
RIGHT WELL UM SINCE I'M IN CHARGE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE SHOULD PUT ON THIS THING SINCE I HAVE TO TRY TO SELL IT </s>
UM I THOUGHT THAT THE METHOD I SHOULD FOLLOW WOULD BE GATHER SUGGESTIONS FROM EVERYBODY </s>
AND TH THE REASON I JUST PUT THAT THERE LIKE THAT IS THAT UH IN THE INIT IN THE INITIAL STAGE I THINK I SHOULD JUST BE OPEN TO LOTS OF SUGGESTIONS </s>
YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT NO MATTER HOW SILLY IT SOUNDS YOU KNOW IT SHOULD RUN YOUR CAR </s>
IT SHOULD HEAT UP YOUR MOTOR IF SHOULD UM TURN ON YOUR C. D. WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO DO UM AND THEN AS WE GO ON WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO IS ACCEPT AND ELIMINATE THESE SUGGESTIONS ACCORDING TO UM DESIGN AND BUDGET FEASIBILITY </s>
SO I'LL BE COMING TO YOU UM FREQUENTLY AS THE INDUSTRIAL EXPERT TO TELL ME HOW HARD IT'S GONNA BE TO ADD A FEATURE OR HOW EXPENSIVE IT'S GONNA BE OR IF YOUR TIME </s>
IF IT TAKES FIVE YEARS TO DEVELOP THIS IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE CAN'T DO </s>
SO IN THE BEGINNING JUST HAVE A BIG PUDDLE OF THINGS THAT WE ANYBODY CAN TH THROW ANYTHING IN AND THEN JUST WEED THINGS OUT THAT CAN'T BE DONE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER </s>
AND THEN THE THINGS THAT SEEM THE MOST ATTRACTIVE THAT TO UH TO A CUSTOMER WE'LL TRY TO THEN PRIORITISE THOSE </s>
SO THAT WAS UM WHAT I MEANT THERE </s>
AND AS I SAID ON THE SLIDE THERE CONSULTING THE INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER ABOUT THAT AND THE OTHER THING IS TIMING IS REALLY GONNA BE AS IMPORTANT AS MONEY </s>
BECAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA SELL THIS THING I THINK THE BEST TIME TO SELL IT IS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT </s>
TWENTY FIVE EUROS MAKES A NICE LITTLE PRESENT AND WE WANT IT TO BE AN IMPULSE PURCHASE </s>
WE WANT SOMEBODY TO SEE IT AND THINK IT'S GEE I JUST GOTTA HAVE THAT </s>
AND TAKE OUT THEIR WALLET AND BUY IT </s>
SO IT'S GOTTA BE REALLY ATTRACTIVE AND IT BUT IT'S GOTTA GO TO MARKET BY SEPTEMBER </s>
'CAUSE ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE OUT THERE IN SEPTEMBER SHOWING IT AROUND ISN'T GONNA SELL FOR CHRISTMAS </s>
UM AND THEN I'LL BE COMING TO YOU AS THE USER INTERFACE PERSON TO TRY TO TELL ME FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW WHAT ARE THE MOST FRIENDLY FEATURES THAT WE COULD PUT ON IT AND TRY TO PRIOR HELP ME WITH THAT PRIORITISING OF UH OF THE FEATURES AND OF THE THE LOOK AND THE COLOUR AND I'LL BE COMING BACK TO YOU TO HELP WEED OUT THOSE SUGGESTIONS FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW </s>
SO I'LL BE COMING TO YOU FOR HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST US AND HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE YOU </s>
AND I'LL BE COMING TO YOU TO TELL ME WHAT'S GONNA MAKE SOMEBODY TAKE OUT THEIR WALLET YOU KNOW </s>
WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S GONNA REALLY BE WHAT THEY CALL A SIZZLE 'CAUSE WE GOTTA SELL THIS SIZZLE </s>
A LOT OF TIMES THE THING THAT WORKS THE BEST FROM AN ENGINEERING POINT OF VIEW ISN'T THE THING THAT SOMEBODY'S REALLY JUST GONNA TAKE OUT THEIR WALLET AND BUY FOR CHRISTMAS FOR FOR THEIR CHILD OR FOR THEIR HUSBAND OR WHATEVER </s>
OKAY CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
ALRIGHT I I ALREADY DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH AFTER OUR FIRST MEETING WHERE WE THREW OUT SOME IDEAS AND IT LOOKS TO ME THAT WITHIN THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE UH THE WHOLE HOUSE IDEA REALLY ISN'T GONNA BE POSSIBLE </s>
SO I'D LIKE YOUR SUGGESTIONS TO COME BACK TO THE OTHER SLIDE WHERE I WAS SAYING WE WE COULD SUGGEST ANYTHING </s>
I'D LIKE THE SUGGESTIONS TO BE REALLY SPECIFIC SO THAT WE'LL HAVE A LIST OF THINGS WE CAN CROSS OFF </s>
NOT SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW WHOLE HOUSE CONTROL WHAT'LL BE AND THEN I FOUND ON THE INTERNET FROM FROM MY RESEARCH THAT SOME EXTENDED ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT CONTROL SHOULD BE POSSIBLE </s>
AT THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND AT THE PRICE POINT WE'RE LOOKING AT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK THE T. V. THE V. C. R. </s>
THE STEREO SET UM MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE CUTE LIKE A COFFEE POT OR ONE OTHER APPLIANCE OR MAYBE A LAMP </s>
I HAVE TO WIND UP </s>
YEAH SURE </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
OF COURSE YEAH </s>
OKAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING </s>
OKAY SO </s>
OKAY </s>
ALRIGHT THANKS FOR THAT </s>
UM ALRIGHT NOW OTHER THINGS THAT I FOUND OUT ON IN MY RESEARCH IS THAT THE COMPLAINTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE OUT THERE NOW </s>
'CAUSE A LOT OF THEM TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE </s>
AND THAT WAS THIRTY FOUR PERCENT BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THE THING THAT WE DID ADDRESS IN OUR LAST MEETING THAT FREQUENTLY IT'S LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM </s>
UM SO THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE DEFINITELY DO WANNA ADDRESS </s>
UH WE WANNA S MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE WE WANNA MAKE IT UM OBVIOUS AND INTUITIVE TO USE </s>
AND THEN THE THINGS ABOUT FINDING IT WE TALKED ABOUT THE A LIGHT EMITTING THING AS WELL AS UH MAYBE A BEEP </s>
AND I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THINGS AFTER MY RESEARCH THAT WE DEFINITELY WANNA TRY TO INCORPORATE </s>
'KAY CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
OKAY SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES IN THIS UM PROJECT ARE REALLY HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE SIZZLE </s>
THAT IS THE SELLING POINT THE THING THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT AN IMPULSE PURCHASE </s>
UH BECAUSE ONCE THERE'S NO BE BACK WELL IN SALES THEY ALWAYS SAY YOU KNOW BE BACKS DON'T COME BACK </s>
IF SOMEBODY SAYS OH I'LL COME BACK AND GET IT NEXT WEEK YOU'RE DEAD </s>
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA COME BACK AND BUY IT </s>
YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH SO THEY BUY IT NOW NOW NOW W NOW IS A BIG WORD IN IN MY BOOK FOR SELLING THIS THING </s>
AND IN ORDER TO MAKE IT REALLY SELLABLE WE'VE GOTTA SHORTEN THE LEARNING CURVE MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE </s>
WE HAVE TO HAVE AS FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE MORE BUTTONS IS MORE CONFUSION SO THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING SIMPLICITY IS GOOD </s>
FINDING IT'S IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T USE IT IF YOU CAN'T FIND IT </s>
SO WE'VE GOTTA CONCENTRATE ON THE FEATURES THAT HELP YOU FIND IT AND I'VE ALREADY SAID THIS SEVERAL TIMES BUT I PUT IT DOWN IN WRITING HERE </s>
IT SHOULD BE AN ATTRACTIVE IMPULSE PURCHASE AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS </s>
SO IT HAS TO HAVE ENOUGH VALUE THAT WHEN SOMEBODY LOOKS AT IT THEY SAY UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THAT </s>
HAS TO BE SO GREAT THAT THEY'RE GONNA SAY UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS ISN'T MUCH </s>
UM AND THEN MAYBE A MOTTO LIKE WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE CAN USE IN OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN </s>
OKAY THAT'S UH ABOUT IT FOR ME RIGHT NOW </s>
OKAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>

YEAH WELL THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ELIMINATED BY MANAGEMENT SO WE'RE OFF THE HOOK </s>
MM OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
WELL WE ALREADY ELIMINATED THAT </s>
NOW THAT'S GOOD FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW THE FUN THE FUN SHAPE </s>
AND THAT YOU YOU SAY THAT WON'T ADD TOO MUCH TO THE BUDGET </s>
TO D THE SHAPE IS UH </s>
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE OF UM HAVING SER IN HAVING BASICALLY THE SAME MACHINE WITH THE SAME BUTTONS BUT MAYBE SEVERAL DIFFERENT SHAPES </s>
IS THAT GONNA BE A POSSIBLE </s>
'CAUSE THAT MIGHT HELP WITH THE MARKETING </s>
BECAUSE WE HAD SOMETHING SORT OF SEXY FOR ADULTS AND WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING SORT OF SILLY FOR CHILDREN OR A LITTLE ANIMAL SHAPE OR IN A OR A LITTLE ELEPHANT SO THEY CAN REMEMBER WHERE IT IS </s>
MM </s>
WELL </s>
I THINK I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'LL HAVE TO DISCUSS UM WITH THE USER INTERFACE PERSON BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR ONE BUTTON FOR ONE FEATURE </s>
BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT IN MY WHAT I FOUND OUT IN MY RESEARCH IS WHEN THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO LEARN A NEW ONE </s>
THE CHANGING MODES WAS SOMETHING I MEAN YOU AND I ALL F ALL FOUR OF US WE WORK WITH COMPUTERS ALL THE TIME </s>
CHANGING MODES IS NOTHING FOR US BUT PEOPLE WHO </s>
N AND </s>
AND THAT'S AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING PEOPLE LEARN BY FEEL AND UM YOU DON'T FEEL THE MODE CHANGE </s>
SO UM MAYBE HAVING BUTTONS BE VARIOUS SHAPES MIGHT BE A HELP TOO </s>
YOU KNOW LIKE THE A TRIANGLE IS FOR THE VOLUME AND A SQUARE IS FOR CHANGING CHANNELS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UH DEVELOP A TACTILE SENSE OF IT </s>
BUT WE'LL GET TO THAT WITH YOU </s>
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH </s>
NOW THAT'S A GOOD POINT </s>

FROM EVERYONE TO SEE HOW SHE BEST COULD MARKET UH THIS THIS PRODUCT AT THE WITHIN THE BUDGET UH THAT WAS GIVEN </s>
UH IN GENERAL THE IDEA IS THAT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO USE </s>
UM IT'S ALSO AN ITEM THAT PEOPLE LOSE A LOT </s>
SO WE SHOULD ADDRESS THAT </s>
AND OF COURSE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING </s>
S S THAT IS VERY SIMPLE TO USE </s>
IN ADDITION TO THAT TO MAKE IT SELL OF COURSE UH THE MARKETING MANAGER W WISHES THAT IT BE VERY ATTRACTIVE </s>
OR LIKE SHE SAYS PUT SOME SIZZLE INTO IT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER </s>
SO THAT THE PEOPLE ARE BUYING IT NOW BECAUSE IN PARTICULAR WITH SMALLER ITEMS </s>
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT FACT 'CAUSE UM IF THEY SAY WELL I GO HOME AND THINK ABOUT IT THAT WON'T WORK </s>
UM ALSO MENTIONED WAS IT SHOULD BE UH IT SHOULD HAVE A VERY SHORT LEARNING CURVE </s>
AND MAYBE IT COULD BE SOLD BY USING A SLOGAN </s>
OUR TECHNICAL MANAGER HAS THEN SAID THAT SHE FEELS IT SHOULD HAVE A CHIP </s>
THAT HAS INFRA RED BITS AND IT HAS AN INTERFACE CONTROLS W INTERFACE THAT CONTROLS THE CHIP </s>
THEREFORE MESSAGES UH WILL BE CONTROLLED IN THE SAME MANNER </s>
THERE SHOULD BE EXTRA FEATURES LIKE LID BUTTONS MAYBE A BEEP </s>
IF TOO MANY BUTTONS ARE PRESSED </s>
MM UH UH CHILD LOCK UM AND UH MAYBE A DISPLAY CLOCK SO THAT PEOPLE COULD UM </s>
YOU COULD SEE THE TIME YOU KNOW WHAT SHOW THEY WANT TO WATCH </s>

YES </s>
YES </s>
OKAY I CAN START FIRST </s>
OKAY </s>
NOW MY SLIDE PLEASE </s>
THREE </s>
PARTICIPANT THREE </s>
YES </s>
OKAY </s>
NOW AS AN INTERFACE DESIGNER I WOULD GIVE MORE EMPHASIS ON THE INTERFACE </s>
HOW THE REMOTE LOOKS LIKE SO THAT IT IS SELLABLE IT IS ATTRACTIVE TO CUSTOMERS </s>
NEXT PLEASE </s>
OKAY </s>
NOW THE FUNCTION OF A REMOTE IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION </s>
THIS MESSAGES COULD BE UH SWITCH ON OFF MESSAGE OR SWITCH TO NEXT CHANNEL MESSAGE OR SWAPPING THE CHANNELS OR SWITCHING ONTO A PARTICULAR CHANNEL </s>
LIKE YOU CAN HAVE THE NUMBERS ONE TWO THREE FOUR UP TO NINE </s>
PARDON ME </s>
YES NINE NUMBERS </s>
AND THEN YOU HAVE SWAPPING OF UH BUTTON BY WHICH USING WHICH YOU CAN SWAP THE CHANNELS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THE THIRD CHANNEL YOU CAN SWAP IT TO THE FOURTH CHANNEL OR VICE VERSA </s>
THEN IT SHOULD HAVE A NEXT BUTTON AND NEXT BUTTON CHANNEL BY WHICH YOU CAN KEEP ON UH V UH MM EH SCROLLING THE CHANNELS ONE BY ONE </s>
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE A BUTTON WHICH SHOULD WHICH CA WHICH CAN BE USED FOR INCREASING OR DECREASING THE VOLUME </s>
THEN THERE SHOULD BE A BUTTON WHICH CAN GIVE SUBTITLES FOR A PARTICULAR PROGRAM WHICH IS GOING ON A TELEVISION </s>
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE WATCHING A FRENCH PROGRAM AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH </s>
THEN THERE SHOULD BE A CHANNEL WHICH CAN TRIGGER THIS MECHANISM IN THE TELEVISION SO THAT THE USER CAN SEE UH THE THE SUBTITLES ON THE SCREEN </s>
THEN THERE SHOULD D UH THERE SHOULD BE SOME BUTTONS WHICH CAN CONTROL FEATURES LIKE THE COLOUR </s>
COLOUR OF THE PICTURE THE CONTRAST SHARPNESS BRIGHTNESS OF THE PICTURE </s>
NOW THERE SHOULD BE A MEMORY SWITCH </s>
THERE SHOULD BE A MUTE BUTTON </s>
SUDDENLY IF IF IF UH UH VIEWER HE GETS A TELEPHONE CALL AND IF HE WANT HE DOESN'T WANT TO SWITCH OFF THE UH T. V. </s>
BUT HE HE CAN REDUCE THE SOUND HE CAN BRING THE VOLUME DOWN AND HE CAN WATCH HE CAN UH WHILE TALKING HE CAN WATCH THE T. V. </s>
NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IN MY REMOTE WOULD BE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION FEATURE </s>
IT'S AN INTEGRATED PROGRA PROGRAMMABLE SAMPLE SENSOR SPEAKER UNIT </s>
SO A REMOTE CAN BE TH CAN BE UH DESIGNED WHICH CAN HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNISERS YOU CAN RECORD YOUR OWN VOICE </s>
WHICH CAN BE RECOGNISED BY AS VOICE RECOGNISER IN THE TELEVISION FOR EXAMPLE </s>
IF YOU WANT TO SEE WE IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE NINTH CHANNEL IF YOU SAY JUST SAY NINTH CHANNEL </s>
UH TH NOW THE THE UH YEAH THE REMOTE WILL AUTOMATICALLY IT WILL SWITCH TO THE NINTH CHANNEL </s>
SO THE T. V. WILL HAVE SOME RECOGNISER WHICH WILL RECOGNISE THE USER'S VOICE AND ACCORDINGLY IT WILL CHANGE ITS FUNCTIONALITIES </s>
SO THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY IMPORTANT FEATURE A REMOTE CONTROL CAN HAVE </s>
SO THIS IS ONE ONE OF THE INTERFACE WHICH CAN BE CREATED </s>
A VERY SIMPLE INTERFACE WHICH HAS ALL THE T UH UH IMPORTANT FEATURES </s>
THEN PLEASE NEXT SLIDE </s>
THEN THESE ARE SOME OF THE REMOTES WHICH ARE DIFFERENT IN SHAPE AND COLOUR BUT THEY HAVE MANY BUTTONS </s>
SO UH SOMETIMES THE USER FINDS IT VERY DIFFICULT TO RECOGNISE WHICH BUTTON IS FOR WHAT FUNCTION AND ALL THAT </s>
SO YOU CAN YOU CAN DESIGN AN INTERFACE WHICH IS VERY SIMPLE AND WHICH IS USER FRIENDLY </s>
EVEN A KID CAN USE THAT </s>
SO CAN YOU GO ON T T UH TO THE NEXT SLIDE </s>
YEAH SO THIS IS ONE OF THE INTERFACE OR ONE OF THE REMOTE WHICH HAS THIS VI VOICE RECOGNISER </s>
AND THIS HAS MULTI PURPOSE USE IT CAN BE USED FOR T. V. IT CAN BE USED FOR CABLE SATELLITE IT CAN BE USED FOR V. C. R. D. V. D. S AND AUDIO </s>
AND THIS HAS IN BUILT VOICE RECOGNISER </s>
CAN YOU GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE </s>
YEAH NOW THIS IS AN INTERFACE FOR A CHIL UH FOR A REMOTE UH UH WHICH A CHILD CAN USE </s>
UH THIS IS USER FRIENDLY IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE AND UH CHILDREN CAN USE IT AS WELL AS THEY CAN PLAY WITH IT </s>
AND THIS COMES WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS DIFFERENT SHAPES </s>
AND THIS THIS UH CHILD UH INTERFACE HAS MINIMUM BUTTONS AND ALL THE IMPORTANT UH BUTTONS ARE THERE IN THIS SMALL COMPACT </s>
ATTRACTIVE CHILD INTERFACE </s>
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
NOW THIS IS A BIG OVER SIZED REMOTE WHICH CANNOT BE MISPLACED OR IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MISPLACE </s>
THIS </s>
SO THIS IS NO THIS IS A VERY BIG YOU CANNOT MISPLACE IT ANYWHERE </s>
SO THIS IS A JUMBO UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO IM MISPLACE OR LOSE </s>
THIS I THIS IS ONE SUCH INTERFACE WHICH CAN BE CREATED </s>

PARTICIPANT TWO </s>
UH THE NEXT ONE SORRY </s>
IT'S IT WAS THE OLD ONE </s>
COMPONENTS </s>
UM THIS TIME I'M I'M GOING TO UM CONCENTRATE MORE ON THE COMPONENTS AND THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER DESIGN </s>
UH CAN YOU GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
I HAVE JUST BRIEF UH DOWN FEW UH COMPONENTS WHICH WE REQUIRE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL UH CONSTRUCTION </s>
UH THE FIRST ONE IS CASE TO KEEP ALL THE COMPONENTS LIKE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT BATTERY ETCETERA ETCETERA IT'S LIKE </s>
UH IT CAN BE A PLASTIC ONE HARD PLASTIC SO THAT IT CAN BE STRONG </s>
EVEN IF YOU JUST UH UH YOU KNOW IF YOU IF IT FALLS DOWN THEN IT DOESN'T BREAK </s>
SO IT SHOULD BE STRONG </s>
AND UH UH THERE ARE NO HARMFUL MATERIALS USED IN THAT </s>
AND IT SHOULD BE RECYCLABLE </s>
UH AND UH YEAH AND ALSO UH USING OF COLOURING COMPON COMPONENTS LIKE UH IF WE WANT TO HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS </s>
BLUE RED GREEN SO UH UH WE HAVE TO USE UH SOME COLOURING COMPONE COMPONE COMPONENTS </s>
AND UH THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING IS UH UH UH INTEGRATED CIRCUIT </s>
UH WHICH UH WE CAN USE A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED ONE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE IT'S LIKE THE HEART OF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER </s>
IF IT IS NOT EFFICIENT THEN EVERYTHING WI IS GOING TO BE UH LIKE UM THE LEF ESS LESS EFFICIENT SO IT YOU SHOULD WE SHOULD HAVE A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED ONE </s>
AND IT SHOULD BE RESISTANT TO HIGH AS WELL AS UH LOW TEMPERATURES </s>
SUPPOSE IF IT IS THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES OUTSIDE FORTY DEGREES OUTSIDE </s>
IT SHOULD IT SHOULD UH BE ABLE TO RE UH RESIST THE UH TEMPERATURE UH UH HIGHS AND UH HIGH TEMPERATURES AND LOW TEMPERATURES </s>
AND UH IT SHOULD BE WITH UH UM EQUIPPED WITH TIMER AND ALARM FACILITY </s>
AND THE UH OTHER COMPONENT WE SHOULD UH WE HAVE IN THE REMOTE CONTROLLER IS A RESISTOR UH WHICH IS LIKE UH UH I IT IS VERY VERY MUCH IMPORTANT FOR THE ELECTRICITY UH FLOW THROUGH THROUGH THROUGH THE UH REMOTE CONTROLLER AND UH ALSO A CAPACITOR WHICH IS A B WHICH IS A M I THINK IT'S IT'S LIKE A BATTERY </s>
CAPACITOR </s>
CAN YOU GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
UH A DIODE A TRANSISTOR A RESONATOR </s>
THESE ARE ALL THIS UH TECHNICAL UH ELECTRI ELECTRONIC COMPONS UH COMPONENTS WHICH ARE WHICH WE HAVE TO USE IN A REMOTE CONTROLLER </s>
A BATTERY UH I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST ONE THING UH IF WE </s>
UH IF WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A RES RECHARGEABLE BATTERY THEN WE SH WE NEED NOT GO FOR A HIGH PERFORMANCE BATTERY </s>
EVEN IF IT IS A LOW PERFORMANCE BATTERY IT CA IT CAN'T L IT CAN'T CHARGE MUCH </s>
IT IT IT'S NOT A HIGH VOLTAGE BATTERY </s>
THEN ALSO WE CAN IF IT IS A RECHARGEABLE ONE THEN UH PEOPLE CAN USE IT FOR A LONG TIME </s>
SO IN THAT WAY WE CAN CUT CUT THE COST BUT W UH UH THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE BATTERY AS RECHARGEABLE ONE </s>
AND WE WE HAVE A CIRCUIT BOARD UH IN A REMOTE CONTROLLER </s>
CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
AND HOW IT WORKS HOW THE REMOTE CONTROLLER WORKS </s>
WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON </s>
THANK YOU </s>
UH WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON WHEN YOU DO THAT </s>
YOU COMPLETE A SPECIFIC CONNECTION THAT MEANS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON THERE WILL BE A S A SMALL CIRCUIT UNDERNEATH THE BUTTON </s>
AND IT WILL SEND SOME SIGNALS THROUGH THE WIRES AND THEN UH THE CHIP WILL SEND START CONNECTION AND KNOWS THAT WHICH BUTTON IS PRESSED </s>
SUPPOSE YOU HAVE PRESSED CHANNEL ONE BUTTON NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE PRESSED THEN THE UH CHIP WILL KNOW THAT THE NUMBER ONE BUTTON WAS PRESSED </s>
IT PROS PRODUCES A MORS MORSE CODE LINE SIGNAL SPECIFIC TO THAT BUTTON </s>
EVERY BUTTON EVERY INDIVIDUAL BUTTON HAS ITS OWN MORSE CODE </s>
SUPPOSE UH THE UH USER HAS PRESSED BUTTO BUTTON ONE THEN IT WILL HAVE A SPE THE CIRCUIT WILL GENERATE A SPECIFIC MORSE CODE TO B THAT THAT BUTTON </s>
AND THE TRANSISTOR WILL AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL AND SEND THEN TO THE L. E. D. WHICH TRANSLATES THE SIGNAL INTO INFRARED LIGHT </s>
LIKE YOU HAVE GOT A SIGNAL BY PRESSING A BUTTON </s>
THAT'S A D A MORSE CODE HAS BEEN GENERATED BY THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT </s>
NOW THAT SIGNAL THAT MORSE CODE HAS TO BE AMPLIFIED BY THE TRANSISTOR </s>
THAT IS THE USE OF TRANSIST TRANSISTOR WE WHICH WE USE IN THE REMOTE CONTROLLER </s>
IT WILL AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL AND IT WILL SEND IT TO THE L. E. D. AND WHICH TRANSLATES THE SIGNAL INTO AN INFRA INFRARED BITS </s>
THE SENSOR ON THE T. V. CAN SEE THE INFRARED LIGHT AND SEEING THE SIGNAL SEEING THE SIGNAL RE IT REACTS APPROPRIATELY </s>
THAT WHEN IT SEES THE AMPLIFIED MO MORSE CODE SIGNAL THEN IT WILL UH IT WILL UH KNOW WHICH UH WHAT WHAT ACTION IT HAS TO UH DO </s>
THEN IT WILL DO THE APPROPRIATE ACTION </s>
SO UH THIS IS HOW THE REMOTE CONTROLLER WORKS </s>
CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
YEAH I HAVE FEW PICTURES </s>
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE UH UM REMOTE CONTROLLER UH IT'S IT'S IT THIS IS A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROLLER </s>
AND TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
AND WHERE WE HAD A A FEW BUTTONS AND ALL </s>
AND UH IF YOU OPEN THE REMOTE CONTROLLER YOU HAVE THIS CIRCUI CIRCUIT BOARD AND FEW ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS </s>
LIKE YOU CAN SEE A CHIP THERE WHICH IS HAVING EIGHTEEN PINS </s>
AND ALSO A CAPAC UH A CAPACITOR THREE RESISTORS AND ALSO A RESONATOR UH UM MM YEAH AND DI AND A DIODE TRANSISTOR </s>
THE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS UH ALL OF THE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS HAVE ALL THOSE UH THINGS LIKE A CHIP AND D DIODE TRANSISTORS AN </s>
YEAH DI UM CAN Y UH YOU CAN SEE THE T. A. DOUBLE ONE EIGHT THREE FIVE LABELLED UH CHIP UM </s>
UH YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE UH UH THE GREEN TWO GREEN THINGS ARE UH THESE ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE RESISTORS </s>
AND UH JUST BESIDE THAT YOU CAN SEE A TRANSISTOR AND A UH UH CYLINDER SHAPE UH THAT ONE IS A CAPACITOR </s>
UH AND ALSO THERE ARE UH UM RESISTORS UH SORRY THER THERE IS A DIODE </s>
CAN YOU GO GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE </s>
SO UH THIS IS THE CIRCUIT BOARD </s>
THE GREEN ONE IS A CIRCUIT BOARD </s>
ACTUALLY UH BUILDING A CIRCUIT BO BOARD IS PRETTY PRETTY UH EASY AND ALSO IT'S A IT'S A L L INEXPENSIVE </s>
UH IT'S IT COSTS LESS THAN WHAT YOU PRINT ON A PAPER </s>
BECAUSE UH UH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING UH SOME CIRCUITS SOME UM UH CIRCUITS AND ALSO WIRES </s>
IT'S IT'S BETTER TO GO FOR PRINTING BECAUSE UH YOU CAN BUILD THESE KIND OF K CIRCUIT BOARDS ON A ON A BULK AND IT'S JUST PRINTING </s>
NOTHING LIKE UH YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED TO USE WIRES AND ALL </s>
IT'S NOT EXACTLY WIRES WE ARE USING </s>
IT'S JUST PRINTING SOMETHING ON A BOARD </s>
THA THO THOSE PRINTS WILL ACTI ACT AS WIRES AND CI UH CIRCUITS </s>
SO TH THAT GREEN UH THING IS A CIRCUIT BOARD </s>
AND ALSO YOU CAN SEE UH THERE ARE B S LIKE UH UM ACCESS FOR BUTTONS LIKE WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON </s>
THE CIRCUIT UNDER THE BUTTON WILL BE ACTIVATED UH TH IT WILL IT WILL HE GET SOME SIGNALS FROM IT AND IT WILL UH IT WILL CH ITS CH SE SEND A SIGNAL SIGNALS TO THE </s>
YEAH UM INTEGRATED CIRCUIT </s>
CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE </s>
UH SO THIS IS THESE ARE THE CIRCUITS UN UNDERNEATH THE BUTTONS </s>
UH CAN YOU SEE THE BLACK UH ROUND MARKS </s>
THEY THEY ARE THE CIRCUITS </s>
NEXT PLEASE </s>
AND UM LIKE UH WE HAVE UH DESIGNED UH BEFORE WE HAVE SEEN SOME UH FEW THINGS LIKE INSTEAD OFF BUTTONS WE HAVE SOME SCROLLS </s>
UH B BUT A B A PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP UNDERNEATH IT BUT WHEREAS A SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES NORMALLY A REGULAR CHIP WHICH IS A HIGHER PRICE RANGE </s>
LIKE FOR S SCROLLS WE HAVE TO GO FOR A SOPHISTICATED AND AND K UH UH UH FULL A COMPLETE CHIP </s>
UH AND A AS ENERGY SOURCE WE OFFER A BASIC BATTERY A MORE INGENIOUS UH HARD DYNAMO </s>
UM A KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY MORE THAN WHAT IS THAT YOU SHAKE CASUALLY TO PROVIDE ENERGY </s>
SO THAT ALSO WE CAN HAVE IN A BATTERY UH OR WE CAN USE SOLAR SELLS </s>
UH </s>
YEAH </s>
UH YEAH UH THE PRODUCT CAN BE DE DELIVERED INTO DIFFERENT CASES </s>
UH USUALLY THE CASES AND CARD FLAT THAT W WE SEE USUALLY UH D UH A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROLLER </s>
UM </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH MAYBE D UH I HAVE JUST ONE MORE SLIDE I THINK </s>
UM </s>
LIKE WE CAN HAVE A MA MATERIAL SUCH AS PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD TITANIUM BUT TITANIUM WE CAN'T USE </s>
UM AND ALSO FOR ELECTRONICS WE CAN USE A SIMPLE AND REGULAR UM RE OR AN ADVANCED CHIP ON THE PRINT </s>
UM ALSO INFRA IT INCLUDES THE INFRARED SE SENDER </s>
UM YEAH THE UH FOR THE MOVIE JUST TO J DEVELOP UH SAMPLES AND SO SPE SAMPLE SPEAKER </s>
AN YEAH THAT'S IT </s>
IT'S ALL FOR ME NOW THANK YOU </s>
NO NO NO TH THE THE THE SCROLLING WHEELS ARE DIFFERENT LIKE YOU CAN GO FOR A SW SWITCHES LIKE BUTTONS OR SCROLLS </s>
UH WHICH WHICH WE USED TO DO BEFORE TEN TEN YEARS BEFORE I THINK </s>
NOW NOBODY USES THAT BECAUSE YOU NEED YOU NEED A A K SOPHISTICATED CHIP AND ALL </s>
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER WE GO FOR UH UM ORDINARY BUTTONS </s>
YEAH UH YEAH PUSH BUTTONS </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH BUT W </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH BUT BUT I WHAT I'M UH VERY VERY MUCH DOUBTFUL HOW HOW UH FAR IT WILL WORK </s>
BECAUSE A SPEECH RECOGNISER LIKE I IT IT HAS ITS OWN UH UH PROBLEMS ISSUES </s>
YEAH IT'S NOT DISTANCE PROBLEM IT IT'S RECOGNISING A PERSON'S VOICE </s>
LIKE MAYBE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WILL BE HAVING DIFFERENT VOICES SO IT LIKE IT'S UH EVERYTHING SO I </s>
SO TO GET A GOOD RECOGNI RECOGNISING SYSTEM IT'S A COSTLY THING I THINK </s>

YOU DON'T KNOW ME </s>
I COULD LOSE THAT IN A MINUTE </s>
WELL UM LOOKS LIKE WE STILL HAVE QUITE A CHOICE OF THINGS OUT THERE </s>
UM WHAT UH I'M NO SUGGESTION'S BAD </s>

I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN GET UH THE T SHAPE IS GOOD THE CHILD ONE IS GOOD THE TOO BIG TO MISPLACE I THINK IT'S JUST FUNNY </s>
UM I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA BE OUR IMPULSE PURCHASE AT THE CHECKOUT COUNTER </s>
IT'S IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT TOO UNWIELDY </s>

UH YEAH ON THE SCROLL AND THE PUSH BUTTON UM CA YOU CAN ACHIEVE SCROLLING BY REPEATEDLY PUSHING A BUTTON </s>
MM-HMM </s>
UM </s>
WE'LL JUST GO FOR PUSH BUTTONS FOR IN THE INTEREST OF COST </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
GO RIGHT TO MY FIRST MY NEXT SLIDE </s>
UM ALRIGHT MY METHOD IS UH I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT THE COMPETITION IS DOING AND WANNA SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE OURSELVES DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPETITION </s>
SO I'VE REALLY BEEN LOOKING AT THE PRESS AND THE ADS THAT ARE OUT THERE FOR OTHER REMOTE CONTROLLERS </s>
I S I SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE INTERNET UM SURFING AROUND DOING THE SAME THING </s>
AND THEN WHEN I'M OUT UM IN PEOPLE'S HOUSES OR AT MEETINGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT </s>
I TRY TO NOTICE WHAT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROLS PEOPLE HAVE AND IF IT'S CONVENIENT IN THE CONVERSATION I ASK ABOUT IT </s>
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO DO THE SAME </s>
UM AND MY FINDINGS FROM THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL </s>
UM PEOPLE LIKE SOMETHING THAT REALLY FITS IN THEIR HAND </s>
SIMPLE IS BEAUTIFUL </s>
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO SQUINT AT SMALL PRINT UM THEY WANT BUTTONS WHOSE FUNCTIONS ARE OBVIOUS </s>
AND THEY WANT UM AS FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE AND THEY DON'T CARE FOR THE MODE THING </s>
THEY WANT EACH BUTTON TO DO SOMETHING </s>
AND EYE CATCHING IS IMPORTANT </s>
IT'S GOTTA LOOK CUTE IT'S GOTTA LOOK APPEALING </s>
GO AHEAD I'M TRYING TO FINISH FAST FOR YOU </s>
UM AND OUR PREFERENCE IS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED ARE WE GOT TO GET TO THE MARKET BEFORE THE COMPETITION </s>
OURS HAS TO BE LOOK REALLY GREAT AND IT HAS TO COME OUT BEFORE THE OTHERS </s>
SO THAT WE HAVE A LEG UP ON TIME TO SELL IT AND PUSH IT BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE GET OUT THEIR CHRISTMAS ITEM </s>
AND WE SHOULD DEVELOP ONE OR TWO FEATURES WE CAN REALLY DWELL ON IN OUR AD CAMPAIGN </s>
IF WE TRY TO TELL PEOPLE IT HAS TOO MANY GREAT FEATURES UM THE CONSUMER JUST GETS CONFUSED AND WE DON'T GET ANYWHERE </s>
SO WE'VE GOTTA NARROW OUR SELECTION DOWN TO LI TWO THINGS I THINK THAT WE GONNA SAY ARE REALLY GREAT ABOUT OUR OUR OUR NEW PRODUCT </s>
AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING AROUND UM AT WHAT DESIGNS EVERY YEAR DIFFERENT THINGS ARE POPULAR </s>
AND IN MY RESEARCH THIS YEAR I FOUND OUT THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SHAPES ARE REALLY POPULAR </s>
AND PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF HARD PLASTIC AND HARD METAL </s>
THEY ARE MORE BACK INTO SOFT FEEL SPONGY FEELING THINGS THINGS WITH MAYBE A LITTLE CLOTH ON THEM </s>
SO THOSE ARE THINGS MAYBE WE WANNA LOOK AT AS FAR AS SALEABILITY OF THE ITEM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YOU WANNA TRY TO COME BACK TO YOURS AND LIMIT YOURS A BIT </s>
OKAY </s>
SO SPEECH RECOGNITION IS MOST IMPORTANT AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED </s>
YEAH H THAT COULD THAT COULD THAT COULD BE OUR STAR FEATURE </s>
THAT THAT BE REALLY GOOD YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT </s>
DISTANCE PROBLEM </s>
UH </s>
I THINK I THINK BATTERY AND I THINK WE ALL AGREED ON THAT </s>
THAT THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND THE BEST THING </s>
YEP </s>
BRIGHT COLOURFUL TRENDY TRENDY DESIGN AND STRONG </s>
MM-HMM </s>
WELL I THINK THAT </s>
YEAH OR OR LIKE HER SPEECH RECOGNITION WOULD ALSO BE A SUPPLEMENT </s>
HER SPEECH RECOGNITION FEATURE WOULD BE A SUPPLEMENT </s>
OKAY SO WHY DON'T WE PUT DOWN SPEECH RECOGNITION IF POSSIBLE PENDING SOME MORE RESEARCH FROM OUR INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER ON HOW EXPENSIVE THAT IS </s>
OKAY </s>
WHEREVER THEY'RE HIDING </s>
WELL HI EVERYONE AGAIN </s>
UM LIKE BEFORE WE UH I HAVE TO REDO THE MEETINGS FROM N TH THE MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING AND SO HERE WE GO </s>
UH IT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE LAST MEETING UH WHICH WAS OPENED BY THE PRESENTATION FROM THE INTERFACE UM </s>
DESIGNER THAT UH LOOKS WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT ON THIS NEW REMOTE AND UM IT IS TO SEND MESSAGES OF COURSE TO THE T. V. </s>
IT SHOULD HAVE NINE CHANNEL BUTTONS A NEXT BUTTON VOLUME BUTTONS SUBTITLE BUTTONS SWITCH TO CONTROL FEATURES COLOUR CONTRAST SHARPNESS ETCETERA </s>
IT SHOULD HAVE A MEMORY SWITCH A MUTE BUTTON IN CASE THE TELEPHONE RINGS OR SOMETHING </s>
UH SPEECH RECOGNITION IS ONE OF HER VERY F FAVOURITE PERSONAL UH FEATURES SHE WOULD LIKE SEE D D TO BE INTEGRATED IN THIS UM IN THIS NEW REMOTE </s>
UM </s>
SHOULD BE CHILD FRIENDLY DESIGN WITH FEW BUTTONS COLOURFUL MAYBE WITH S STAR SHAPED OR OTHER SHAPED BUTTONS </s>
UM SHE UH PRESENTED ALSO AN OVERSIZED REMOTE WHICH SHE GUARANTEES NOBODY WILL EVER BE ABLE TO LOSE </s>
UM </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
BUT UH HER VERY F PERSONAL FAVOURITE REALLY SHE SHE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE A SPEECH RECOGNISER INTEGRATED IN THIS REMOTE </s>
THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UM PRESENTED HER UH THOUGHTS ON THE ISSUE </s>
SHE WOULD LIKE A SPECIAL CASE MADE OUT OF PLASTIC THAT IS VERY STRONG NOT USING ANY HARMFUL MATERIALS SHOULD BE RECYCLABLE AND SHOULD BE COLOURFUL </s>
SHOULD HAVE AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT BOARD THAT'S HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED AND TEMPERATURE RESISTANT </s>
SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TIMER AND OR ALARM FACILITY INTEGRATED </s>
UH TECHNICALLY THIS THING WOULD ALSO HAVE A RESISTOR AND A CAPACITOR DIODE TRANSISTOR RESONATOR AND IF POSSIBLE A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY </s>
UH AND OF COURSE A CIRCUIT BOARD </s>
AND HOW IT WOULD WORKS YOU PRESS THE BUTTON </s>
THE CHIP IS MORSE MORSE CODE RELATED RELAYS THE UH TO THE GENERAT TO THE GENERATOR AMPLIFICATION AND UH THE CIRCUIT BOARD IS VERY INEXPENSIVE TO BUILD AND SO SHE THINKS THIS IS A GREAT FEATURE UH TO TO TO CONSIDER </s>
SHE WOULD LIKE UH THIS WHOLE THING SHOULD BE PUSH BUTTONS WITH A SIMPLE CHIP </s>
UH SCROLLING METHOD IS MORE EXPENSIVE AND NOT THAT PRACTICAL ANYMORE </s>
SHOULD BE BATTERY OPERATED AND OF COURSE SHE WOULD HAVE THE SPECIAL CASES </s>
THE MARKETING EXPERT UH WHO HAS TO FINALLY COME UP WITH TO TO TO MARKET THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN WATCHING THE COMPETITION </s>
HAS DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND ALSO HAS USED H HER PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS TO COME UP WITH THE FACT THAT SUCH A REMOTE SH SHOULD BE SMALL </s>
EASY TO USE AND IT SHOULD BE EYE CATCHING </s>
FROM HER POINT OF VIEW OF COURSE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTS IS THAT WE SHOULD GET TO MARKET BEFORE OUR COMPETITION DOES </s>
TO DO THAT UH MAYBE ONE OR TWO FEATURES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED ON WHICH WE COULD DWELL ON OR IN OTHER WORDS ON WHICH OUR CAMPAIGN COULD BE BUILT ON </s>
TOO MANY NEW FEATURES OR TOO MANY POINTS WOULD ONLY CONFUSE MATTER </s>
SO WE PREFER TO HAVE ONE OR TWO FEATURES THAT CAN BE REALLY UH DRIVEN HOME </s>
UM IT SHOULD HAVE A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE DESIGN AND SHOULD HAVE A SOFT FEEL </s>
SHE FEELS THAT'S REALLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT TODAY </s>
AND THE DECISION THAT WE TOOK LAST TIME WAS THAT UH THE SPECIAL FEATURE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS A SPEECH RECOGNISER </s>
THE ENERGY SHOULD BE BATTERY UH SHOULD BE ON A CHIP SHOULD BE TRENDY DESIGN COMPACT AND STRONG AND SHOULD HAVE BUTTONS </s>
AND THAT CONCLUDES THE PRESENTATION FROM THE LAST MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING </s>
NOW UH WE ARE READY FOR THE PRESENTATION OF THE PROTOTYPE </s>

WELL I HAVE ONE QUESTION UH WILL THERE BE ANYTHING WRITTEN ON THE BUTTONS </s>
LIKE THAT PEOPLE KNOW OR THEY HAVE TO LEARN THAT FROM A PIECE OF PAPER WHICH BUTTON DOES WHAT </s>
WILL HAVE SYMBOLS SO THAT THAT THAT THE USER REALLY KNOWS YOU KNOW AND DOESN'T HAVE TO FIRST LEARN IT </s>

THAT WOULD REALLY WORK </s>
SO </s>
I THINK VOICE RECOGNITION IS OUR BIG SELLING POINT 'CAUSE NOBODY ELSE SEEMS TO HAVE THAT IN IN THIS PRICE RANGE </s>
YEP UH WELL I THINK THAT EVERYBODY'S GONNA SAY THEIR REMOTE CONTROL IS PRACTICAL </s>
I THINK WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO DWELL ON ON ON THE APPEARANCE </s>
WE'RE REALLY GONNA HAVE THE BE THE </s>
CUTEST REMOTE CONTROL ON THE BLOCK </s>
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO PLAY WITH THE IMAGE PLAY WITH THE SNAIL IMAGE UM PLAY WITH THE VISUAL AND THEN THE VOICE RECOGNITION </s>

WE CAN'T ACCEPT EVERY SUGGESTION OF COURSE BUT MAYBE WE JUST NEED TO GET A FEW </s>
AND SHOW THE THE PROTOTYPE TO CONSUMER RESEARCH GROUPS </s>
WE DON'T S WANT SOMEBODY TO SUDDENLY COME TO US AND TELL US THAT THIS BUTTON IS TOXIC AND YOU KNOW SOME CHILD WILL SWALLOW IT AND THEN WE WON'T SELL ANY </s>
SO WE HAVE TO GET SOME INPUT FROM THOSE PEOPLE </s>

WE WANTED THE FEEL TO BE AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE WE'LL HAVE THE SOFT BUTTONS AND THE WAY THIS IS SHAPED </s>
EVEN THOUGH IT'S GONNA BE HARD PLASTIC IT FEELS GOOD IN YOUR HAND SO THAT'S NICE </s>

BUT UM ON THE CORPORATE INFORMATION SIDE THERE'S A TH UH THERE WAS REAL REMOTE INSTEAD OF REAL REACTION </s>
REAL REMOTE IS NOT REALLY THE COMPANY WE'RE WE ARE BUT IT'S JUST A LITTLE FAULT </s>
UM OKAY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO </s>
UH OUR PROJECT AIM IS AS YOU CAN SEE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL </s>
IT HAS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY </s>
SO THESE ARE UH THE POINTS WHY UH WE ALSO HIRED YOU </s>
WE'VE GOT THE MARKETING EXPERT FOR UH THE TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY LOOK </s>
AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UH THERE'S ALSO USER FRIENDLY AND A BIT ORIGINAL </s>
AND WE'VE GOT OUR USER INTERFACE DESIGNER </s>
HE'S ALSO UH </s>
THAT'S ABOUT THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL </s>
UH PROJECT METHOD UM IS UH THERE ARE THREE PHASES WE ARE GOING THROUGH </s>
FIRST IS FUNCTIONAL DES UH DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK MEETINGS </s>
AFTER THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THEN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THE DETAILED DESIGN </s>
I HAD SOME ROLE INDICATIONS ON HERE </s>
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW IT ALREADY BY YOURSELF </s>
THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER IS GOING TO WORK ON THE WORKING DESIGN UH COMPONENTS DESIGN AND A BIT OF THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN </s>
UH THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER IS GOING TO DO THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND USER INTERFACE DESIGN </s>
AND THE MARKETING EXPERT IS DOING A LITTLE BIT OF USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION TREND WATCHING AND PROJECT UH PRODUCT EV EVALUATION </s>
SO THAT'S A BIT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO </s>
BUT THAT WILL BE ALL WORKED OUT IN UH OTHER MEETINGS </s>
THEN WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST TOOL TRAINING </s>
WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH A LOT OF HIGH TECH TOOLS HERE SO IT'S AB IT'S HANDY IF WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TRAINING FIRST </s>
AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT THE SMART BOARDS HERE AND HERE IN THE WHITE BOARD </s>
UM IN THE WHITE BOARD HERE THERE'S A LITTLE TOOL BAR ON THIS SIDE </s>
HERE ARE SOME FUNCTIONS </s>
YOU CAN SAVE </s>
N UH THESE FUNCTIONS WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ONLY UNDO YOU CAN UNDO A LITTLE </s>
UH PIECE OF DRAWING </s>
A BLANK NEW DOCUMENT FOR EACH PERSON </s>
UH SELECT A PEN ERASER </s>
CAPTURE WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH </s>
UH THEN WE'VE GOT OUR PEN </s>
THIS PEN </s>
IT'S REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE YOU CAN DRAW WITH IT ON THIS PAGE UM IN THE THINK IT IS FORM OF </s>
YOU CAN ALSO SELECT THE CURRENT COLOUR AND THE LINE WIDTH </s>
BUT THEN FIRST YOU HAVE TO SELECT THE PEN FUNCTION </s>
BUT WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH IT IN A MINUTE </s>
SO OKAY </s>
UH THAT'S VERY SIMPLE AND IT'S EASY TO UH DRAW YOUR FINDINGS AND DRAWINGS ON THERE </s>
UH THEN </s>
A SHORT THING ABOUT DOCUMENTS </s>
WE'VE GOT OUR SHARED FOLDER UH PROJECT PROJECT WHAT WAS IT </s>
PROJECT DOCUMENTS I THINK </s>
BUT ALL YOU WILL FOUND THAT ALREADY BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF DOCUMENTS IN IT ALREADY SO IT WILL BE OKAY </s>
AND THESE ARE AVAILABLE ON THE SMART BOARDS AS WELL SO IF YOU HAVE A DOCUMENT YOU WANNA SHOW JUST OPEN IT FROM THE FOLDER </s>
HERE IS A SIMPLE TOOL BAR </s>
IT'S WHAT I JUST SAID IT'S SAVE PRINT MOVE BACK OR FORWARD ONE PAGE </s>
YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DRAWINGS </s>
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TRY OUT THE WHITE BOARD </s>
SO AS YOU CAN SEE WE G ALL GOING TO DRAW A ANIMAL </s>

MOUSE WASN'T RUNNING AWAY </s>
IS EVERYBODY IS ANYBODY PLAYING WITH THE MOUSE </s>
NO </s>
OKAY </s>
WE'RE GOING TO UH DRAW ANIMAL </s>
AND UH JUST SUM UP A FEW OF ITS FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS </s>
UM THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO UH LOOK AFTER IS THAT WE USE DIFFERENT COLOURS AND DIFFERENT LINE WIDTH </s>
UH THERE'S I CAN START FROM NOW </s>
I WILL </s>
YOU CAN USE THIS PEN BY HOLDING IT LIKE A LIKE A LITTLE CHILD </s>
BECAUSE IF YOU HOLD IT LIKE THIS THE SENSORS WILL GET BLOCKED AND THEN THE DRAWING WON'T GET GOOD </s>
ANOTHER THING IS YOU HAVE TO BE UH A BIT SLOW </s>
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DRAW LIKE REALLY FAST THEN UM THE PEN WON'T HOLD UP </s>
SO WE CHOOSE FORM OF CURRENT COLOUR UH I THINK GREY IS APPROPRIATE </s>
THEN THE LINE WIDTH </s>
I THINK SEVEN WILL BE NICE </s>
NOW YOU'LL SEE MY DRAWING CAPABILITIES </s>
THESE ARE NOT VERY MUCH BUT UH </s>
UH SEE YOU HAVE TO DO IT REAL SLOW </s>
OH </s>
AH I WAS TRYING TO DRAW A DOLPHIN BUT I THINK HIS NOSE HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S CLOSE </s>
SO WHAT YEAH IT'S THIS IS BIT OF THE SWORDFISH </s>
YEAH HE HASN'T GOT AN EYE </s>
WOAH </s>
NOW WE'VE GOT ANOTHER FUNCTION </s>
WE'VE GOT THE ERASER </s>
AND THEN YOU CAN UNDO </s>
THIS EASILY </s>
AH IT'S OKAY </s>
AND I'VE GOT TO WRITE DOWN A FEW OF ITS CHARACTERISTICS </s>
UH IS </s>
THEY'VE GOT NO TEXT TOOL NO </s>
UH </s>
OKAY </s>
THIS IS TYPICALLY A UNDO ACTION I THINK </s>
PEN </s>
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT A BIT </s>
UPSIDE DOWN </s>
I THINK THAT'S IT BECAUSE IF YOU WAN AR ARE GOING TO DO IT LIKE THIS THEN IT WILL BE A STRIPE </s>
BUT I DON'T KNOW I'M JUST TRYING </s>
THIS IS NOT MY WORK OKAY </s>
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO USE </s>
OH </s>
UH </s>
I THINK IT'S A IT WANTS TO DRAW A ANOTHER ANIMAL </s>
I DON'T KNOW </s>
IT LIVES FOR THE FUN </s>
SO </s>
IT'S MY CHARACTERISTIC UH CHARACTERISTIC ABOUT THE DOLPHIN </s>
IT LIVES FOR THE FUN </s>
SO NOW I'M GONNA HAND OVER THE PEN ON THE NEW BLANK SHEET TO YOU </s>
GO AHEAD </s>
MAYBE IT'S EASIER TO DRAW THE SMALLER LINE WIDTH I THINK </s>
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING A LOT BETTER THAN UH I DID </s>
IT'S NICE </s>
UH </s>
IT'S A REAL DEAD SHEEP YEAH </s>
FOR RECOGNITION YEAH I SEE </s>
UM MAYBE YOU CAN ALSO WRITE YOUR NAME SOMEWHERE </s>
ON JUST A </s>
YEAH </s>
NICE </s>
SWEET </s>
YEAH JUST A BLANK SHEET </s>
NO </s>
YEAH IT'S PRETTY SKINNY CAT </s>
IS YOUR CAT OR DID YOU FIND HIM ON THE STREET </s>
AH </s>
OKAY </s>
THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR </s>
SO EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO WORK WITH THE WHITE BOARD NOW </s>
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OR IF YOU WANNA DRAW ANYTHING ON THE WHITE BOARD JUST ASK AND GO AHEAD </s>
IT'S PRETTY UH EASY </s>
'KAY </s>
S HAUNTED WHITE BOARD </s>
SO WE'VE GOT THE TOOL UH INTRODUCTION </s>
WE </s>
MOVE ALONG TO THE PROJECT FINANCE </s>
UM AS YOU CAN SEE WE UM FOR OUR REMOTE CONTROL A SELLING PRICE IS UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS </s>
OUR SELLING PRICE </s>
UH OUR PROFIT AIM IS FIFTY MILLION EUROS </s>
UH THAT'S THE LEAST WE HAVE TO GET FROM OUR REMOTE CONTROLS SO WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO REACH OUR AIMS </s>
UH WE CAN DO IT INTERNATIONAL SO WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENT KIND OF USERS DIFFERENT KIND OF CULTURES AND DIFFERENT KIND OF TRENDS AS WELL </s>
UM BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE LATER STADIUM </s>
OUR PRODUCTION COST UM CAN BE MAXIMAL TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS </s>
SO THAT'S ALSO A POINT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE WON'T MAKE REMOTE CONTROLS WITH SMALL TELEVISIONS INSIDE AND STUFF LIKE THAT </s>
IT WON'T WORK </s>
SO JUST TRY TO REMEMBER THESE POINTS </s>
SELLING PRICE TWENTY FIVE PROFIT AIMS FIFTY MILLION UM BUT MORE IMPORTANT IS THE INT INTERNATIONAL MARKET WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON </s>
AND PRODUCTION COST UH MAXIMAL TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS </s>
SO THAT'S LEADS US TO OUR LITTLE DISCUSSION </s>
WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES LEFT FOR DISCUSSION </s>
SO I'M GONNA SIT DOWN I THINK </s>
IT'S EASIER </s>
I'VE GOT A MESSAGE </s>
FIVE MINUTES </s>
OKAY THAT'S UH GOOD TIMING </s>
UH MAYBE YOU HAVE TO SAY THE MAGIC WORD </s>
DOES IT DO ANYTHING </s>
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO JUST CLAP IT DOWN </s>
MM BACK UP AGAIN </s>
NO SLIDE SHOW </s>
HMM </s>
IT'S OFF </s>
NOW YOU HAVE TO PUT IT BACK O OH YEAH </s>
YOU'LL BE OKAY I THINK </s>
WELL IT'S THOSE LAPTOPS </s>
NICE </s>
OKAY </s>
BUT SO MM DOES EVERYBODY HAS UM EXPERIENCES WITH UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND I MEAN NOT THE ORDINARY MOTE CONTROLS BUT ALSO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ONES </s>
LIKE YOU CAN USE FOR OTHER </s>
NO </s>
YOU </s>
AH YEAH </s>
YEP </s>
YEAH I'VE I'VE GOT ONE AT HOME </s>
AND YOU CAN UH PROGRAM I THINK EIGHT DIFFERENT DEVICES IN IT AND YOU CAN USE IT FOR YOUR TELEVISION ANYTHING ELSE </s>
AND IT ALSO OPERATES ON INFRA RED SO YOU HAVE TO GOT THE LITTLE DEVICE INSIDE YOUR ROOM </s>
AND THEN YOU CAN OPERATE IT FROM THE THIRD OR TH OR SECOND FLOOR </s>
SO THAT'S PRETTY HANDY WHEN YOU HAVE A VIDEO RECORDER OR D. V. D. PLAYER DOWNSTAIRS AND YOU'VE GOT A LINK TO YOUR T. V. ON THE SECOND FLOOR </s>
SO THAT'S A PRETTY HANDY UM </s>
THING </s>
UM BUT ONLY THE </s>
I THINK THAT IF YOU CAN PUT DIFFERENT KIND OF DEVICES IN ONE REMOTE CONTROL IT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER AS WELL </s>
IT'S UH </s>
THAT'S GOOD TO REMEMBER </s>
YEAH THAT'S NICE I THINK </s>
SO WE'VE WE WANT DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS </s>
UH AND WE CAN MAYBE SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THE INFRA RED </s>
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL EXCEED THE PRODUCTION COSTS </s>
SO THAT UH THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO FIND OUT I THINK </s>
AND OTHER FUNCTIONS FOR A REMOTE CONTROL </s>
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT UH UH </s>
SHOCK PROOF </s>
SURE </s>
WATERPROOF </s>
OKAY </s>
SO THESE ARE OUR UM A FEW THINGS WE CAN THINK OF </s>
UM I WILL PUT THE MINUTES FROM THIS MEETING UH IN OUR PROJECT FOLDER </s>
THAT'S A BATTERY STAYS </s>
YEAH </s>
UH </s>
THAT'S AN IDEA AS WELL </s>
OTHER IDEAS </s>
QUICK IDEAS </s>
OKAY </s>
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS UH PRESENTATION </s>
KICK OFF PRESENTATION </s>
NO </s>
OKAY THEN I'LL PUT THE MINUTES FROM THIS MEETING IN THE PROJECT FOLDER </s>
AND THEN WE CAN ALL WORK </s>
FINISH MEETING NOW </s>
OKAY </s>
AND WE CAN ALL WORK UH ON OUR OWN PROJECTS </s>
OKAY THEN I'LL MEET YOU IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR I THINK </s>

THERE </s>
'KAY I'M NOT MUCH OF AN ARTIST BUT HERE WE GO </s>
MM </s>
OKAY </s>
THIS IS MY UM HMM </s>
SHEEP </s>
WITH OF COURSE </s>
LITTLE BLUE DOT THEY ALWAYS GET SPRAYED ON THEIR BUTTS </s>
THERE </s>
YEAH </s>
'KAY </s>
THEY ARE </s>
COME ON </s>
YOU HAVE TO GO REALLY SLOW WHEN YOU'RE WRITING </s>
THEY'RE BRILLIANT ANIMAL ANIMALS </s>
AND THAT'S JUST A LITTLE ME THINGY </s>
SO </s>
GUESS I'LL PASS THE PEN TO OUR USER INTERFACE DESIGNER </s>
INTERESTING </s>
A RABBIT </s>
GARFIELD </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
AND THE MOST INTERESTING TAIL </s>
YEAH </s>
WE'RE BEING HAUNTED </s>
YEAH YOU GOT A MESSAGE </s>
SO JUST ON A SIDE NOTE WHY IS IT MY LAPTOP IS ONLY GIVING ME A BLACK SCREEN </s>
YEAH </s>
RIGHT </s>
NO </s>
IT'S OFF NOW </s>
WELL IT WAS ON BUT </s>
AH THERE WE ARE </s>
WELL WE HAVE A </s>
KIND OF BROAD T. V. AT HOME AND A D. V. D. PLAYER SO WE GOT LIKE A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS </s>
ONE FOR THE T. V. ONE FOR THE VIDEO RECORDER ONE FOR THE D. V. D. PLAYER </s>
AND I THINK IT'S IT WOULD BE BEST TO JUST MAKE ONE REMOTE CONTROL THAT CAN OPERATE THEM ALL </s>
OH REALLY </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
SO I THINK YOU CAN TAKE MINUTES AGAIN </s>
SINCE IT'S YOUR JOB </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
BUT THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD IF WE COULD DO THAT </s>
UM </s>
THINK IT HAS TO BE SHOCK PROOF </s>
'CAUSE </s>
MY REMOTE CONTROL TENDS TO FALL A LOT </s>
SO </s>
YEAH ONE OTHER LITTLE THING </s>
THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HANDY TO PUT A BATTERY STATUS DISPLAY ON IT </s>
SO YOU CAN SEE </s>
HOW MUCH IS LEFT IN THE BATTERY </s>
BUT THEY'LL ALSO REALLY DRAG UP THE PRODUCTION COSTS SO THINK WE'LL HAVE TO SEE ABOUT THAT TOO </s>
BUT MAYBE JUST A LITTLE LED I DON'T KNOW </s>
UM </s>
NOPE DON'T THINK SO </s>
OKAY </s>
AYE SIR </s>
HALF AN HOUR </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
EVERYBODY FOUND HIS PLACE AGAIN </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S NICE </s>
OKAY SO THIS IS OUR SECOND MEETING </s>
AND UH STILL FAILING </s>
UH NOW WE'RE GOING UM INTO THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN </s>
UM IMPORTANT THING OF THIS PHASE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO UH TRY TO GET AN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE USER REQUIREMENTS TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN AND THE WORKING DESIGN </s>
SO THAT WE CAN MOVE ONTO THE SECOND UH PHASE </s>
BUT FIRST THIS PHASE </s>
UM FIRST AN ANNOUNCEMENT </s>
THERE'S A LITTLE ADAPTATION IN THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM </s>
SO </s>
THERE'S OUR GHOST MOUSE AGAIN </s>
THAT THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THE AIR CONDITIONING THAT'S BECAUSE OF THIS UH </s>
IT'S IN WING C. AND E. </s>
SO IT SHOULD BE OVER IN A IN A WHILE COUPLE OF DAYS </s>
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE COLD ANYWAY SO I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT </s>
THEN OUR AGENDA </s>
NOW FIRST THE OPENING </s>
UH THIS TIME I WILL TAKE THE MINUTES </s>
UH YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRESENTATION </s>
ALL OF YOU </s>
UM AND WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES FOR THE WHOLE UH PRESE FOR THE WHOLE UH PRESENTATIONS </s>
SO UH I SUGGEST WE TAKE ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES PER PRESENTATION </s>
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS UH WHICH HAVE BEEN SENT TO ME </s>
AND THEN THE DECISION ON THE CONTROL FUNCTIONS UH WHICH WE WANNA INCLUDE AND THOSE WHICH WE DON'T WANNA INCLUDE </s>
SO WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES FOR ALL OF IT </s>
SO I SUGGEST UM LET'S START WITH THE FIRST PRESENTATION </s>
UM WHO WANTS TO BE FIRST </s>
OKAY </s>
SO </s>
JUST MAYBE IT'S EASIER IF YOU UM YEAH I THINK YOU WILL TELL YOUR PRESENTATION AS WELL </s>
JUST WHICH FUNCTION YOU HAVE AND WHAT YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT </s>
OKAY </s>
THANK YOU </s>
SO ANYBODY HAVE UM ANY QUESTIONS UNTIL NOW </s>
ABOUT FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS </s>
OKAY THAT'S CLEAR </s>
NOW TO THE SECOND </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH YOU CAN TAKE YOUR TIME </s>
WE'VE GOT UH PLENTY OF TIME SO </s>
YEAH </s>
THERE IT IS </s>
YEAH </s>
ONE REMOTE </s>
HMM </s>
'KAY </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
ANYBODY HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS </s>
YEAH </s>
TOUCHSCREEN </s>
HUH </s>
'KAY </s>
THAT'S NICE </s>
UH </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
UH MAYBE WE CAN FIRST UM LISTEN TO YOUR PRESENTATION </s>
UH AND THEN WE HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS AND UH DESIGN </s>
I THINK IT'S GOING TO UH IT'S NOT TOO MUCH </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
THANK YOU </s>
OKAY </s>
UH </s>
OKAY NOW I HOPE EVERYBODY HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE INSIGHT IN THE FUNCTIONS WE ALL HAVE AND WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW </s>
UM I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER SO I'M HERE TO MESS THINGS UP AND UH TELL YOU SOME NEW UH REQUIREMENTS </s>
UM THAT'S WE'VE UH GOT TO DESIGN A UM REMOTE WHICH IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR T. V. </s>
UM THAT'S BECAUSE UH IT WILL BE TOO COMPLEX AND THE TIME TO MARKET WILL BE TOO BIG IF WE WANNA HAVE IT UH FOR MORE FUNCTIONS </s>
SO IT HAS TO BE SIMPLE </s>
UH ANOTHER POINT IS WE HAVE TO SKIP THE TELETEXT </s>
BECAUSE IN THE WORLD OF UH UPCOMING INTERNET UH WE THINK TELETEXT IS GOING TO BE UH A THING OF THE PAST </s>
AND UH IT'S A FUNCTION WE DON'T NEED IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL </s>
UM INTERNET IS ALSO MENTIONED IN A FUNCTION WE CAN USE </s>
UH MAYBE ALSO ON TELEVISIONS IT WILL BE AVAILABLE AS WELL </s>
ANOTHER ONE IS UH THE CUSTOMER IS UH FORTY PLUS </s>
UH THAT'S THE THE MARKET WE HAVE TO TO TO TARGET BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT WHICH IS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE YOUNGER CUSTOMERS </s>
UM THIS IS UH A BIT PITY FOR THE MARKETING UH EXPERT </s>
BECAUSE HE WAS UH AIMING ON THE THE YOUNGER PERSONS </s>
SO WE HAVE TO FIND A MARKET WHICH IS ABOVE FORTY PLUS UH BUT WHICH WILL SUIT OUR </s>
UH REMOTE CONTROL AND THE OTHER WAY ROUND </s>
AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY UH ATTENT IN UH PUTTING THE CORPORATE IMAGE UH IN OUR PRODUCT </s>
SO IT HAS TO BE VISIBLE IN OUR DESIGN IN THE WAY OUR DEVICE WORKS </s>
AND UH WE HAVE TO BE UH VERY CLEAR ON THIS POINT AS WELL </s>
SO I SUGGEST </s>
LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION ON THE CONTROL FUNCTIONS </s>
YEAH </s>
UH WE CAN SEE IF WE CAN FIND A WAY UH BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONS WE WANNA USE AND THE MARKET WE WANNA REACH WITH OUR PRODUCT </s>
UM </s>
AGAINST THE NO TELETEXT </s>
UM </s>
YEAH IT'S IT IS </s>
STANDARD REMOTE </s>
NO I THINK WE CAN </s>
I THINK WE CAN DO A LOT WITH THE DESIGN AND THE SIMPLE BUTTONS WHICH WERE ALSO MENTIONED </s>
UH IF WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT IN THOSE WE CAN MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH UH JUST TWO OR THREE BUTTONS </s>
OR JUST A REMOTE WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR THE MARKET WE WANNA REACH BECAUSE IT IS FORTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET </s>
AND UM IF YOU LOOK IN HOLLAND AT THE WHOLE GENERATION OF FORTY PLUS </s>
FIFTY PLUS IT IT'S THE THE BIGGEST SHARE OF THE OF THE WHOLE POPULATION NOW </s>
NO </s>
BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF WE MAKE A REMOTE WHICH IS UH TYPICALLY MADE FOR THIS MARKET </s>
THAT PEOPLE THINK THE PEOPLE THINK THAT'S THE THE DEVICE I'VE LOOKED FOR ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T REALISE IT </s>
SO LET'S TRY IT </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
IT'S A BIG SUCCESS </s>
VERY BIG SUCCESS </s>
YEAH </s>
UH </s>
I THINK SO AS WELL </s>
UH I SIMPLY THINK UM </s>
UH THAT THE NEW PRODUCTS WE ARE GONNA MAKE UH SPEF SPECIFICALLY DESIGN </s>
ARE DESIGNED FOR UH YOUNGER PEOPLE UH SO MAYBE WE CAN FOCUS OURSELF ON THE ELDERLY PEOPLE </s>
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO UM SEE WHAT REQUIREMENTS WE NEED FOR THOSE UM REMOTE CONTROLS </s>
'CAUSE WHAT YOU TOLD IS THE CHANNEL SELECTION IS IMPORTANT </s>
VOLUME SELECTION POWER AND TELETEXT </s>
OKAY </s>
UM </s>
NO WE WE HAVEN'T VOTED YET SO UH I THINK TELETEXT CAN BE UH </s>
UM CAN BE A FUNCTION AS WELL </s>
BUT ONLY IF UH IF IT WON'T </s>
HIGHER THE THE COST </s>
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BE A LOT MORE MONEY TO IMPLEMENT TELETEXT AS WELL BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A PROBLEM </s>
OR IS TELETEXT A </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
SO I SUGGEST UH </s>
YEAH </s>
IS ANYBODY UM REALLY AGAINST TELETEXT </s>
NO </s>
JUST THAT THAT WE JUST KEEP THE TELETEXT </s>
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AS WELL ESPECIALLY FOR THE SUBTITLES </s>
MAYBE WE CAN </s>
MAKE THAT UM </s>
ANOTHER POINT OF ADVANTAGE IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL </s>
IF WE UH MAKE A K A BUTTON EX FOR EXAMPLE FOR BIG SUBTITLES WHICH IS INSTANTLY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL </s>
FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE THEY CAN THINK OH I WANNA HAVE SUBTITLES AND THEY PUSH THE BUTTON AND THEY GET THE BIG SUBTITLES </s>
UM SO I THINK TELETEXT CAN V CAN BE VERY USEFUL IN OUR ADVANTAGE </s>
UM </s>
FUNCTIONALITY SHOULD BE FEW BUTTONS YOU SAID </s>
I THINK UH THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE HAVE A FEW BUTTONS </s>
SO TO KEEP IT SIMPLE </s>
NO </s>
YEAH </s>
BUT DO YOU NEED </s>
BUT DO YOU NEED THE BUTTONS FOR ONE TO ZERO </s>
MAYBE C WE CAN </s>
MAYBE WE CAN USE UH </s>
NO MAYBE WE CAN IMPLEMENT THE SCROLL BUTTON </s>
OR A JOYSTICK LIKE </s>
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TOO </s>
JUST LOOK IF YOU LOOK AT TELEPHONES </s>
THE SONY TELEPHONE HAS A SCROLL BUTTON WHICH IS VERY USEFUL IN SEARCHING NAMES OR </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
THE NUMBERS YEAH </s>
YEAH THEY CAN SEE HOW MUCH BUTTONS THERE ARE GOING TO BE ON ON THE DISPLAY AND IF IT'S TOO MUCH WE CAN UH RECONSIDER IT </s>
BUT I THINK THERE WON'T BE VERY MUCH BUTTONS </s>
OR THERE DON'T HAVE TO BE A LOT </s>
THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS </s>
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN THE IN THE DESIGN </s>
YOU CAN MAKE A VERY FANCY DESIGN UH WITH PUTTING THE BUTTONS ON THE RIGHT PLACES </s>
AND IF YOU HAVE LESS BUTTONS YOU CAN DO A LOT MORE WITH </s>
TO OPERATE ONLY THE T. V. YEAH </s>
NO </s>
SO </s>
'KAY </s>
SO WE CAN </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
YEAH </s>
SO YOU SUGGEST WE COULD BETTER UM FOCUS ON FOR EXAMPLE THE DOCKING STATION </s>
UH UH LIKE OTHER FUNCTIONS </s>
INSTEAD OF F OF LESS BUTTONS </s>
MM </s>
NO </s>
DO YOU THINK THE DOCKING STATION WILL </s>
UH IS ALLOWED IN THE BUDGET WE HAVE </s>
'CAUSE IT CAN BE </s>
NO </s>
YEAH </s>
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S UH </s>
THAT'S A GOOD ADVANTAGE POINT AS WELL </s>
IF WE HAVE A FANCY LOOKING DOCKING STATION OR VERY THAT'S A NICE REQUIREMENT </s>
DOCKING STATION </s>
I THINK SO </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S A GOOD POINT </s>
UM </s>
YOU SAID THEY EASILY GET LOST AS WELL </s>
YEAH </s>
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT THE AUDIO SIGN OR SOMETHING </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
SO AUDIO SIGNAL SHOULD BE POSSIBLE AS WELL </s>
I THINK IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE </s>
UH ANOTHER </s>
POINT IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN </s>
UM I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL RISE THE COST TOO MUCH BECAUSE </s>
YEAH </s>
IT WILL BE TOO MUCH AS WELL </s>
YEAH </s>
BASED </s>
JUST THE L. C. D. </s>
OH JUST THE NORMAL SCREEN </s>
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA </s>
SO SOME EXTRA INFO </s>
FEEDBACK </s>
YEAH </s>
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AS WELL </s>
AS THE SMALL SCREEN </s>
EXTRA BUTTON INFO </s>
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE AS WELL </s>
UM LET'S SEE WHAT DID WE SAY </s>
MM </s>
MORE </s>
SHOULD BE FANCY TO FANCY DESIGN EASY TO LEARN </s>
FEW BUTTONS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT </s>
DOCKING STATION L. C. D. </s>
UM GENERAL FUNCTIONS </s>
YEAH </s>
'KAY </s>
AND DEFAULT MATERIALS </s>
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AS WELL BECAUSE UM ELDERLY PEOPLE DON'T MIND IF IT'S A TITANIUM COVER OR JUST A PLASTIC ONE </s>
SO THAT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER </s>
SO I THINK WE NEE </s>
UH LET'S UM SPECIFY THE TARGET GROUP </s>
BECAUSE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ELDERLY ELDERLY PEOPLE OR PEOPLE FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY </s>
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DESIGN NOW IS FOR PEOPLE ABOVE SIXTY MAYBE </s>
UH WHAT DO WE WANT </s>
IF WE WANT UM A WITH UH FOR EXAMPLE THE THE TELEPHONE FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE WE CAN </s>
TARGET THE REAL ELDERLY PEOPLE </s>
YEAH </s>
SO THAT'S THE </s>
NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SIXTY TO EIGHTY FOR EXAMPLE </s>
YEAH </s>
SIXTY </s>
OKAY </s>
AND DIFFERENT CULTURES </s>
ARE WE </s>
OKAY </s>
NO </s>
WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES LEFT JUST NOW </s>
SMALL WARNING </s>
SHOULD </s>
YEAH </s>
IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES YOU KNOW </s>
YEAH </s>
OR YOU HAVE TO PUT A LANGUAGE BUTTON IN IT BUT THAT WILL BE A BIT UNNECESSARY I THINK </s>
IT'S BETTER TO PUT IT ON DIFFERENT MARKETS WITH IT ALL </s>
OKAY </s>
SO THAT'S THE THE TARGET </s>
UH THEN A FEW SMALL THINGS </s>
UH OKAY </s>
I WILL PUT THE MINUTES IN THE PROJECT UH PROJECT DOCUMENT FOLDER </s>
UM WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FOR THE NEXT MEETING IS THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WILL DO THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT </s>
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND THE TREND WATCHING </s>
SO JUST KEEP IN MIND THE THINGS WE'VE SAID ABOUT THE TARGET GROUP UH REQUIREMENTS AND THE TRENDS WHICH ARE UH GOING ON </s>
AND UH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY UH THE PERSONAL COACH </s>
SO UM I THANK YOU FOR THIS MEETING </s>
AND I THINK WE HAVE A LUNCH BREAK NOW </s>
SO THAT'S A GOOD THING </s>
OKAY </s>
MM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
UH OKAY </s>
UM I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT UH THE USER INTERFACE OF IT </s>
UM F FOR THE TECHNO F FUNCTIONS UH OF OF IT </s>
UM </s>
OKAY </s>
MM </s>
OH </s>
UH </s>
OKAY </s>
UM YEAH </s>
I THINK UH WE UH MUST USE THE GENERAL FUNCTIONS UH OF THE UH REMOTE CONTROL </s>
UH UH I'VE DO I'VE UH DONE A LITTLE UH RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND NOT MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT IT UM ABOUT UH INTERFACE BUT UH UH </s>
YEAH I I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT A SIMPLE MANNER UH TO PUT A LOT OF FUNCTIONS UH UH IN ONE UM IN ONE UH REMOTE CONTROL </s>
UH SO UH YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF DEVI UH DEVICES LIKE UH D. V. D. UH UH TELEVISION UH STEREO </s>
SO UM </s>
BUT UH IT MUST BE UH USER FRIENDLY </s>
SO UM UH YOU C YOU CAN'T PUT A A LOT OF UH FUNCTIONS UH IN ONE UH YEAH </s>
UH UH UH YEAH </s>
IN ONE UM REMOTE CONTROL </s>
BUT UM </s>
YEAH </s>
UM YEAH </s>
GOT UH MANY FUNCTIONS IN ONE UH REMOTE CONTROL UM BUT UM YEAH YOU CAN SEE THIS IS UH QUITE SIMPLE UH REMOTE CONTROL </s>
UM FEW UH BUTTONS BUT UH THIS UH RE UH REMOTE CONTROL GOT A A LOT OF UH BUTTONS </s>
UM UH PEOPLE UH DON'T LIKE IT UH SO UM </s>
WELL WHAT UH I WAS UH THINKING ABOUT WAS UM UH KEEP THE GENERAL FUNCTIONS UH LIKE THEY ARE </s>
SO UH LIKE UH THE ON OFF UH BUTTON </s>
UH KEEP IT UH YEAH L LIKE A RED BUTTON </s>
UH EVERYBODY EVERYBODY KNOWS IT SO UH UH YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THAT </s>
UM </s>
MY PERSONAL UH PREFERENCES UM </s>
USE A DISPLAY FOR UH SPECIFIC UH FUNCTIONS OF THE DIFFERENT UH DEVICE </s>
SO UM </s>
WH WHAT I WAS TH UH THINKING ABOUT WAS UM YOU'VE GOT UM </s>
UH THIS THE REMOTE CONTROL UH AND UH YOU GOT HERE THE GENERAL FUNCTIONS </s>
UH LIKE UH THE ON OFF BUTTON UH SOUND UH I DUNNO UM AND UM HERE YOU'VE GOT A S KIND OF A DISPLAY </s>
IT'S A TOUCHSCREEN </s>
SO UM YEAH YOU GOT A GENERAL F UH F THE FUNCTIONS OF THE DEVICE UH FOR A D. V. D. PLAYER OR UH SO UM THE PL YEAH UM F FOR UH PLAYING UH REVERSE UH </s>
AND UM YOU GOT HERE UH REAL BUTTONS FOR UH SELECTING UH A DEVICE </s>
SO UM THIS BUTTON IS FOR A D. V. D. OR SO UM FOR EVERY UM DEVICE YOU'VE GOT A UH A F A B A PART UH DISPLAY OF A PART BUTTONS </s>
SO UH YOU YOU NEVER GOT UH ALL THE BUTTONS UH ON W ONE DEVICE </s>
SO UH THAT'S UH MY UH IDEA ABOUT IT </s>
UM YEAH AND </s>
UH LET'S SEE </s>
UH YEAH </s>
SO A TOUCHSCREEN </s>
UH AND UM TH THE BUTTONS UH THE REAL BUTTONS UH WE HAVE TO USE UM </s>
WE BETTER C UM UH USE UH QUITE UH LARGE BUTTONS UH FOR UM YEAH </s>
EVERYBODY UH HAVE TO USE IT SO </s>
UH OL EVEN EVEN OLD PEOPLE UM YOUNG PEOPLE </s>
SO UH WE MUST KEEP UH BUTTONS UH QUITE S UH SIMPLE AND QUITE LARGE </s>
SO UH UM </s>
YEAH </s>
UH YEAH </s>
THAT WAS UH MY UH PART OF IT </s>
SO </s>
N I I DON'T THINK SO </s>
UH YOU GOT UH QUITE A CHEAP UH TOUCHSCREEN </s>
S UM IT'S UH NOT UH IN COLOUR OR SOMETHING </s>
UH IT'S JUST UH UM ONE COLO UH YEAH </s>
UH I SEEN UH W UH SOMETHING ON THE INTERNET UH NOT TODAY BUT UH A FEW UH WEEKS AGO </s>
UH YOU GOT UH YEAH QUITE AN UH </s>

NO </s>
WELL I THINK IF WE ARE GONNA USE A TOUCHSCREEN UH WE'RE GONNA GO WAY ABOVE THE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS </s>
BUT THE IT WOULDN'T BE VERY ROBUST </s>
IT'S VERY FRAGILE AND YOU CAN GET SCRATCHES ON IT </s>
THAT'S </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY I'VE GOT A PRESENTATION ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN </s>
UM FIRST ABOUT HOW IT WORKS </s>
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE OF COURSE </s>
EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW A REMOTE WORKS </s>
THE USER PRESSES A BUTTON </s>
THE REMOTE DETERMINES WHAT BUTTON IT IS USES THE INFRARED TO SEND A SIGNAL TO THE T. V. </s>
THE T. V. SWITCHES TO THE FREQUENCY OR WHAT FUNCTION IT IS </s>
SO WE'VE GOT UM THE THE PLATE </s>
IT GOTS CONDUCTIVE DISKS FOR EVERY BUTTON </s>
WHEN THE USER PRESSES A BUTTON A SIGNAL GOT SENT GOES TO THE LED AND TRANSMITS TRANMI TRANSMITS ITS TO THE T. V. </s>
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE DEVICE TECHNICALLY SPEAKING </s>
SO THIS IS A SCHEMATIC OVERVIEW </s>
YOU'VE GOT THE BUTTONS </s>
THE POWER SOURCE </s>
AND UH WHEN A BUTTON GETS PRESSED ITS GOES TO THE CHIP </s>
THE CHIP UH CONTROLS THE INFRARED BULB AND PERF PERHAPS A NORMAL BULB </s>
WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE YOUR PRESSED BUTTON </s>
WELL UM I THINK WE SHOULD USE DEFAULT MATERIALS SIMPLE PLASTICS </s>
KEEP THE INNER WORKINGS SIMPLE SO IT'S ROBUST </s>
UH I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS ON AESTHETICS THE DESIGN AND THE USER INTERFACE </s>
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE HIGH TECH MATERIALS THE PRICE IS GOING TO GO SKY HIGH </s>
AND UH YOU ONLY HAVE TO DESIGN A REMOTE ONCE AND IF YOU USE HIGH TECH MATERIALS IT COME BACK IN EVERY PRODUCT </s>
SO IT'S IN MY IDEA IT'S UH IT'S GONNA BE SMART TO INVEST IN DI IN DESIGN AND NOT IN UH IN THE PRODUCT ITSELF </s>
THAT'S IT </s>
I THINK THAT IF WE'RE IF WE PUT OUR MARKETING RIGHT UM WE CAN SELL THIS JUST LIKE UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IT IN THE NEWS </s>
THE THE ELDERLY MOBILE PHONE </s>
YEAH IF WE IF WE MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL JUST L WITH THAT IDEA IN MIND WE COULD MAKE TONS OF MONEY I THINK </s>
WE DON'T HAVE TO FOCUS ON ON ON THE ON THE DESIGN THEN BUT ON FUNCTIONALITY </s>
WE JUST </s>
CHANGE OUR FOCUS ON THE PROJECT AND I THINK </s>
WE CAN UH WE CAN SELL THIS </s>
NO </s>
UH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA </s>
YEAH </s>
AND BESIDES THAT IT'S UM IF WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON ELDERLY PEOPLE THEY'LL HAVE TO ADAPT </s>
THEY'RE NOT USED TO USING SCROLL BUTTONS </s>
SO PERHAPS WE SHOULD S STICK TO THE BASIC LAYOUT </s>
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE YES </s>
IF IT'S NOT TOO FANCY </s>
AND IF THE REMOTE STAYS RATHER SMALL IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE YEAH </s>
YES </s>
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA FOCUS ON THE EXTRAS </s>
YEAH </s>
LIKE WITH YOUR KEY CHAIN IF YOU WHISTLE IT GOES UH IT MAKES A SOUND </s>
YEAH </s>
Y I UM I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE DOCKING STATION OR THE SCREEN 'CAUSE </s>
IT'S UH </s>
WELL I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TELEVISION SETS UH </s>
IN UH EVERY COUNTRY </s>
'CAUSE </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YES </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
NO </s>
YES </s>
THINK I'LL GO FIRST </s>
'KAY </s>
MY NAME IS FREEK VAN PONNEN </s>
I'M THE MARKET EXPERT </s>
BUT YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT </s>
UM I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH </s>
WE HAVE WE UH HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH IN A USABILITY LAB WHERE WE OBSERVED UM USERS OPERATING REMOTE CONTROLS </s>
UH WE LET THEM FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE </s>
WE HAD ONE HUNDRED OF THESE UH TEST SUBJECTS </s>
UH IN ADDITION WE DID SOME MARKET RESEARCH </s>
UH SEE WHAT THE MARKET CONSISTS OF </s>
WHAT AGES ARE INVOLVED </s>
WELL THESE ARE THREE QUITE ASTONISHING RESULTS I THOUGHT </s>
UM REMOTES ARE BEING CONSIDERED UGLY </s>
F UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE UM </s>
PEOPLE QUESTIONED UH INDICATED THAT THEY THOUGHT THEIR REMOTE WERE WAS UGLY </s>
UM AND AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY PERCENT INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY ON A FANCY LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL </s>
SO </s>
UM IN ADDITION REMOTES WERE NOT VERY FUNCTIONAL </s>
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE INDICATED THEY ONLY LOO USED ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL </s>
AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE INDICATED THAT THEIR REMOTE TENDED TO GET LOST IN THEIR ROOM </s>
SO </s>
SOME THINGS </s>
THEN WE DID SOME RESEARCH TO THE MOST RELEVANT FUNCTIONS </s>
CHANNEL SELECTION AND VOLUME SELECTION UM BOTH GOT A TEN ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN FOR RELEVANCY </s>
THE POWER BUTTON GOT A NINE </s>
AND TELETEXT GOT A SIX AND A HALF </s>
SO THESE ARE THE MOST </s>
MOST UH IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL </s>
THEN THERE ARE SOME ONE TIME USE FUNCTION </s>
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THEM </s>
THAT UH AUDIO SETTINGS VIDEO SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS BUTTONS </s>
WHICH ARE NOT REALLY USED VERY FREQUENTLY BUT ARE STILL CONSIDERED TO BE OF SOME IMPORTANCE </s>
UM CHANNEL SELECTION WAS ALSO INDICATED TO BE USED VERY FREQUENTLY </s>
ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES PER HOUR </s>
THEN THESE ARE THE THIS IS THE MARKET </s>
UM SIXTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET CONSISTS OF USERS BETWEEN THE AGES SIXTEEN AND FORTY F SIX </s>
UM </s>
MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS GROUP IS THAT THEY'RE VERY CRITICAL ON THE REMOTE CONTROL </s>
UM THEY LIKE TO USE NEW F NEW FUNCTIONS </s>
BUT THEY ALSO ARE VERY CRITICAL </s>
THEY WON'T SPEND THEIR MONEY VERY EASILY </s>
SO </s>
UM THE USERS OF FORTY SIX TO SIXTY FIVE YEARS CONS THE MAKE UP FORTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET </s>
THEY ARE NOT REALLY VERY INTERESTED IN FEATURES </s>
BUT THEY DO TEND TO SPEND THEIR MONEY A LOT EASIER </s>
UM </s>
WHAT I THINK THIS INDICATES FOR OUR UM </s>
DESIGN </s>
I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE A REMOTE FOR THE FUTURE </s>
AND THIS MEANS WE WOULD </s>
UM HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE AGE AGES SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE </s>
UH THIS ALSO MAKES UP MOST THE BIGGEST PART OF THE MARKET SO THAT WILL ALSO BE WHERE OUR MAIN PROFIT WOULD BE GETTABLE </s>
UM THIS WOULD MEAN WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A FANCY DESIGN </s>
UM </s>
THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT UM ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE QUESTIONED THOUGHT THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL CAUSED R. S. R. S. I. </s>
UM THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT </s>
AND THIRTY FOUR PERCENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS HARD TO LEARN A N HOW TO OPERATE A NEW CONTROL REMOTE CONTROL </s>
SO THESE ARE TWO FACTORS THAT I THINK SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DESIGN </s>
BESIDES OF COURSE THAT THE REMOTE MUST LOOK VERY NICE </s>
AND THE FUNCTIONALITY </s>
AS A LOT OF PEOPLE INDICATED THEY ONLY USE ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE VERY FEW BUTTONS </s>
UH THIS WILL ALSO BE UH BENEFICIAL TO THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE </s>
UH I THINK THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED BUTTONS SHOULD BE EMPHASISED </s>
ESPECIALLY THE CHANNEL SELECTION AND AUDIO UH SELECTION BUTTONS </s>
'CAUSE THEY'RE USED MOST AND SO THEY SHOULD BE ROBUST </s>
THEY SHOULDN'T BREAK DOWN EASILY </s>
UM </s>
THEN AS MO AS A LOT OF PEOPLE INDICATED THAT THEIR UM REMOTE GOT LOST IN THE ROOM IT MIGHT BE </s>
AND I SAY MIGHT BE BECAUSE IT WOULD UM CERTAINLY BOOST THE UH PRODUCTION COSTS A LOT </s>
BUT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE A DOCKING STATION </s>
AND THIS WOULD COULD GET A BUTTON IN IT WHICH WOULD SEND A SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE WHICH WOULD THEN BEEP </s>
SO YOU'D KNOW WHERE IT IS IN THE ROOM </s>
AND IN ADDITION TO THIS IT COULD UM RECHARGE THE BATTERIES IN THE REMOTE IF YOU PUT IT IN </s>
THEN UM A SURPRISINGLY GREAT DEAL OF PEOPLE W INDICATED THAT UM AN L. C. D. SCREEN IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE PREFERRED </s>
THIS WAS UM </s>
MOSTLY PEOPLE IN THE AGE OF SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE </s>
BUT UP TILL FORTY FIVE IT REMAINS FEASIBLE </s>
THIS WOULD ALSO GREATLY INCREASE THE PRODUCTION COSTS BUT I THINK THESE ARE JUST SOME SMALL FACTORS WE COULD CONSIDER </s>
THAT WOULD BE ALL </s>
ANY QUESTIONS </s>
'KAY </s>
YEAH YOU SHOULD GO TO THE TOP THINGY </s>
SLIDE SHOW </s>
OH YEAH </s>
HMM </s>
WELL IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE A FANCY DESIGN </s>
SO </s>
THAT IS TRUE </s>
WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT </s>
YEAH </s>
SO IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION POSSIBLE ABOUT THE NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENT </s>
YEAH 'CAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT TELETEXT IS GONNA BE AN OLD FEATURE AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE USED ANYMORE ANYWAY PRETTY SOON </s>
AND NEW T. V. S WILL HAVE INTERNET ACCESS ON THEM </s>
BUT I THINK IF YOU'RE TARGETING PEOPLE OF FORTY PLUS THE CHANCE THAT THEY WILL HAVE A T. V. WITH INTERNET ACCESS </s>
WITHIN THE NEXT LIKE TWENTY YEARS IS VERY SLIM </s>
IN ADDITION PEOPLE INDICATED THAT TELETEXT SIMPLY WAS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL </s>
SO I THINK IT'S PRETTY DUMB TO PUT NO TELETEXT FEATURE ON IT </s>
I'M PRETTY MUCH AGAINST IT </s>
YES </s>
BESIDES THAT I THINK THE MARKET FOR FORTY PLUS IS LIKE </s>
PRETTY SMALL </s>
BUT I MEAN IF I S IF I SEE THIS IT'S I THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA GO FOR ANOTHER </s>
PRETTY </s>
AND NOT INNOVATIVE </s>
REMOTE CONTROL </s>
YES BUT IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST PART OF THE </s>
MARKET </s>
AND BESIDES THAT THEY'RE NOT VERY CRITICAL SO I MEAN THEY DON'T REALLY CARE </s>
WHAT THE REMOTE CONTROL IS LIKE </s>
THEY'LL JUST PRETTY MUCH TAKE THE FIRST THING THEY SEE AND WHICH LOOKS ACCEPTABLE </s>
NO </s>
I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE CASE IN THE </s>
SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE AGE CATEGORY </s>
BECAUSE THEY ARE CRITICAL AND THEY THEY WANT TO HAVE A FANCY REMOTE CONTROL </s>
PEOPLE OF FORTY PLUS I MEAN THEY WANT IT TO WORK BUT </s>
AS SOO AS SOON AS IT WORKS IT'S OKAY WITH THEM </s>
SO </s>
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT </s>
HMM </s>
YES </s>
YES </s>
BUT OBVIOUSLY THE BOARD TENDS TO DISAGREE </s>
YEAH ALSO </s>
I THINK IT'D DEFINITELY BE A BAD IDEA NOT TO INCLUDE TELETEXT </s>
YES </s>
MM-HMM </s>
BUT </s>
I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY AN ISSUE ANY MORE 'CAUSE </s>
WELL MIGHT BE </s>
BUT I MEAN IT IF IT'S ONLY FOR T. V. YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEED A LOT OF BUTTONS ANYWAY </s>
YOU NEED A ONE TO ZERO BUTTON NEXT CHANNEL PREVIOUS CHANNEL </s>
VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN AND SOME TELETEXT BUTTONS BUT </s>
I THINK IF YOU IF YOU ONLY L </s>
NAH </s>
THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA INCLUDE TELETEXT YOU DO </s>
I THINK MANY PEOPLE LIKE TO USE THAT </s>
'CAUSE IF YOU SHOULD IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH FROM CHANNEL ONE TO LIKE THIRTY FIVE YOU DON'T WANNA PUSH THE NEXT CHANNEL BUTTON THIRTY FIVE TIMES </s>
THAT'S TRUE BUT UM </s>
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY T. V. S THAT CAN SWITCH CHANNELS THAT FAST </s>
AND SO YOU WOULD NEED LIKE </s>
THE T. V. WOULD NEED AN A FUNCTION WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY VIEW ALL CHANNELS AND SCROLL THROUGH IT </s>
AND I DUNNO IF MANY CHANNELS WOULD </s>
DO HAVE THAT </s>
IF MANY T. V. S HAVE THAT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
BUT I DON'T THINK I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL ONLY TO OPERATE A T. V. YOU THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN GAIN ON </s>
UM HAVING AS FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE </s>
'CAUSE I THINK THERE ARE PRETTY MANY REMOTE CONTROLS THAT CAN ONLY OPERATE A T. V. WHICH ALREADY ONLY HAVE THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF BUTTONS </s>
I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH TO BE GAINED IN THAT AREA </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT IS TRUE BUT I THINK THERE'S SIMPLY NOT MUCH TO GAIN ON THE COMPETITION WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A REMOTE CONTROL ONLY FOR TO OPERATE ONLY THE T. V. </s>
'CAUSE IF YOU HAVE A A REMOTE CONTROL ONLY TO OPERATE A T. V. THERE'S SIMPLY NOT A LOT OF BUTTONS REQUIRED </s>
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF FUNCTIONS REQUIRED SO MOST EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS SIMPLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS EITHER </s>
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO ACTUALLY GAIN ON THE COMPETITION HERE </s>
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD COST A A BIG MARKETING </s>
EXPEDITION </s>
WHICH WAS </s>
ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS TO MAKE IT ONLY FOR THE T. V. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO MARKET A LOT </s>
MAYBE </s>
WELL </s>
YEAH I THINK MEAN WE OBVIOUSLY NEED A GOOD WAY TO POSITION ALL THE BUTTONS AND </s>
BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SPEND VERY MUCH TIME IN THAT </s>
YEAH I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD DO SOME RESEARCH INTO </s>
WHAT ELDERLY PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE IN A </s>
LIKE TO HAVE EXTRA IN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL </s>
YES WELL FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE INDICATED THAT REMOTE CONTROL TENDED TO GET LOST </s>
YEAH THAT WAS WHAT I SUGGESTED </s>
YOU HAVE IT ON YEAH YOU HAVE IT'S ON SOME PHONES TOO WHICH HAVE A DOCKING STATION </s>
AND YOU JUST PRESS A BUTTON AND THE PHONE GOES RINGING </s>
SO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS </s>
I THINK SINCE A LOT OF PEOPLE INDICATED THAT A NEW REMOTE CONTROL IS HARD TO LEARN </s>
AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON ELDERLY PEOPLE HERE WHICH TEND TO HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING NEW DEVICES </s>
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE JUST A LITTLE SCREEN ON IT WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN A BUTTON IF YOU PRESS IT </s>
WHICH WOULD TELL YOU WHAT IT DOES </s>
AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE TOUCHSCREEN OR A VERY EXPENSIVE SCREEN BUT </s>
JUST A SMALL SCREEN WITH TWO </s>
YEAH </s>
BUT I DUNNO IF THAT WOULD </s>
THAT WOULD FIT INTO THE </s>
COSTS </s>
NO </s>
I THINK PROBABLY ELDERLY PEOPLE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFUL WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS THAN </s>
YOUNGSTERS </s>
YEAH </s>
I THINK </s>
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A IF WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE A </s>
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR UH FOR THE IMAGE OF THE COMPANY </s>
AND I THINK I THINK THERE WOULD BE A GOOD MARKET FOR IT </s>
IF WE'RE ABLE TO REALLY BRING AN INNOVATIVE PRODUCT </s>
YEAH THE REALLY </s>
BUT </s>
I'D HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT A LITTLE MORE </s>
'KAY </s>
AND WITH UH THE LITTLE SCREEN IN IT WHICH EXPLAINS THE BUTTONS </s>
YOU COULD I THINK WE N IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TO </s>
ADAPT IT TO DIFFERENT CULTURES </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
'KAY </s>
THAT'S GOOD </s>
OKAY </s>
UH GOOD AFTERNOON </s>
THIS IS OUR THIRD MEETING ALREADY </s>
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR LUNCH </s>
I DID ANYWAY </s>
UM LET'S SEE </s>
PRESENTATION THREE </s>
OKAY THIS IS UM THE SECOND PHASE UH WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS TODAY </s>
IT'S THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING </s>
AND A FEW POINTS OF INTEREST IN THIS MEETING UM ARE THE CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION OF COMPONENTS </s>
UH CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION OF DESIGN </s>
AND ALSO TREND WATCHING </s>
UM THESE ARE HOPEFULLY THE POINTS YOU ADDRESSED IN UH YOUR PRE UH PRESENTATIONS YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW ME IN A FEW MINUTES </s>
UM BUT FIRST I'LL SHOW YOU THE AGENDA </s>
UH FIRST THE OPENING </s>
THEN WE HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS </s>
UH AFTER THAT WE HAVE TO COME TO A DECISION ON REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS </s>
HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT </s>
AND THEN WE'RE CLOSING </s>
WE HAVE ABOUT FORTY MINUTES </s>
UH SO I SUGGEST LET'S GET STARTED </s>
UH DID SOMEONE ENCOUNTER ANY PROBLEMS DURING THE PREPARATION </s>
NO </s>
EVERYTHING FINE </s>
THAT'S NICE </s>
THEN A LITTLE UH THING ABOUT THE LAST MEETING </s>
UH THESE ARE THE POINTS UM WE AGREED ON </s>
THE REQUIREMENTS AND THE TARGET MARKET </s>
UH REQUIREMENTS ARE UH TELETEXT DOCKING STATION AUDIO SIGNAL SMALL SCREEN WITH SOME EXTRAS THAT UH BUTTON INFORMATION </s>
AND WE ARE GOING TO USE DEFAULT MATERIALS </s>
UM DOES SOMEBODY HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THESE REQUIREMENTS </s>
MAYBE </s>
NO </s>
THESE ARE JUST THE THE THINGS WE THOUGHT OF SO MAYBE IF YOU FIGURED SOMETHING ELSE OR THOUGHT OF SOMETHING ELSE JUST LET ME KNOW </s>
AND MAYBE WE CAN UH WORK IT OUT </s>
AND WE'RE GOING TO TARGET UH SIXTY TO TO EIGHTY YEAR OLD CUSTOMERS </s>
SO NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WE'RE DO WE'RE DOING UM I SUGGEST LET'S GET STARTED WITH THE PRESENTATIONS </s>
SO SHALL WE KEEP THE SAME UH LINE UP AS UH LAST TIME </s>
OKAY </s>
GOOD LUCK </s>
OKAY </s>
THANK YOU </s>
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THE TRENDS </s>
MAYB </s>
NO </s>
OKAY WE GO ON TO THE NEXT ONE </s>
OKAY </s>
UH THANK YOU </s>
OKAY </s>
THANK YOU </s>
SO THAT BRINGS US TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR CONCEPTS </s>
MM </s>
'KAY </s>
SO THESE ARE THE POINTS WE HAVE TO DISCUSS </s>
UM FIRST </s>
I THINK WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ENERGY SOURCE SINCE THAT'S UM </s>
HAS A PRETTY BIG INFLUENCE ON PRODUCTION PRICE UH AND IMAGE </s>
UH SO </s>
UH F I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO SEE UH IT IS POSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE KINETIC ENERGY IN OUR BUDGET I THINK </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
YEAH </s>
NO </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
UH </s>
UH WELL I THINK UH ELDERLY PEOPLE JUST LIKE TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN PLACE </s>
AND I DON'T THINK THEY THEY LIKE UH REMOTES JUST LAYING EVERYWHERE IN THEIR ROOMS </s>
SO MAYBE A DOCKING STATION WILL HELP THEM GIVE THE REMOTE A PLACE </s>
AND ALSO WHAT YOU SAID </s>
UM YOU CAN INTRODUCE VOICE RECOGNITION BY UH FINDING BACK YOUR REMOTE </s>
BUT I THINK IT'S UM MORE EFFICIENT AND CHEAPER TO PUT IT IN THE DOCKING STATION </s>
SO YOU HAVE A BUT BUTTON ON YOUR DOCKING STATION WHICH YOU CAN PUSH AND THEN IT STARTS BEEPING </s>
AND THEN WE CAN WE CAN STILL USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION BUT MAYBE THEN FOR ONLY THE THE CHANNELS </s>
THAT'S SAFE </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S A GOOD POINT </s>
YEAH SURE </s>
GO AHEAD </s>
NO </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
EASIER TO USE </s>
NO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT </s>
YEAH </s>
I PERSONALLY THINK THE L. C. D. SCREEN WE WANNA USE WITH THE EXTRA INFORMATION I THINK NOBODY HAS ANYTHING AGAINST IT </s>
BECAUSE IT'S JUST UH SOME EXTRA INFORMATION AND IT'S EASY TO IGNORE AS WELL </s>
SO IF YOU DON'T WANNA USE IT YOU JUST DON'T USE IT </s>
AND UM YEAH I THINK THE UM MAYBE WE HAVE TO UH DISCARD THE VOICE RECOGNITION </s>
BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE COST UH SIGNIFI UH SIGNIFICANTLY </s>
AND I DON'T THINK THE I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A LOT EASIER TO USE AS WELL </s>
SO THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE ENERGY </s>
IF WE DON'T HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IT WILL IT WON'T USE A LOT OF ENERGY TO USE </s>
UM </s>
SO IN THAT CASE WE COULD USE KINETIC UH ENERGY BUT I THINK JUST A SIMPLE BATTERY WHICH YOU CAN RELOAD ON A DOCKING STATION IS JUST AS GOOD </s>
AND MUCH CHEAPER AS WELL </s>
SO </s>
OKAY LET ME JUST CHOOSE FOR THE BATTERY </s>
THAT BRINGS US TO THE CHIP </s>
JUST THE ADVANCED </s>
OKAY ADVANCED CHIP </s>
AND THEN WE GET TO THE POINT OF THE CASE </s>
UM WHICH BRINGS US A LITTLE BIT BACK TO MARKETING AS WELL </s>
UH IF WE WANNA CHOOSE FOR WOOD OR THE BLACK AND GREY </s>
OR BOTH </s>
UM AS WE SAW THERE IS NOT YEAH WOOD IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE </s>
UM BUT I THINK IT WILL ATTRACT ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO WANNA HAVE SOMETHING EXCLUSIVE WHICH THEY CAN SHOW OFF TO THEIR GRANDKIDS </s>
LOOK I'VE GOT A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND UH </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
BUT WITH COLOUR WAS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE </s>
OR </s>
YOU DON'T KNOW </s>
I THINK SO BECAUSE YEAH </s>
IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO TO HANDLE AND TO TO GET IN THE RIGHT SHAPE </s>
YEAH </s>
CHANGE THE CASES </s>
YEAH </s>
YOU CAN SELL THE CASES </s>
YEAH </s>
I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD OPTION </s>
BECAUSE UM THEN YOU CAN ADVERTISE AS WELL WITH THE GIVE YOUR GRANDFATHER A NEW CASE FOR HIS REMOTE CONTROL OR WHATEVER </s>
BECAUSE THAT'S A IT'S SOMETHING EXTRA IT'S SOMETHING OTHER REMOTES DON'T HAVE WHICH WE CAN GET A GREAT ADVANTAGE POINT </s>
SO AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE THEM WITH COLOUR </s>
BLACK AND GREY OTHER COLOURS AS WELL </s>
COSTS </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
SO YOU SUGGEST WE SHOULD DESIGN TWO DIFFERENT TELEPHONES </s>
ON WHICH YOU CAN APPLY YEAH REMOTE CONTROLS ON WHICH YOU CAN APPLY DIFFERENT CASE COVERS FOR EXAMPLE </s>
REMOTE </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
SO EVERYBODY'S OKAY WITH THE CHANGING COVERS </s>
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD UH GOOD OPTION </s>
CHANGING CASE COVERS </s>
YEAH </s>
MM </s>
OKAY </s>
UH BUT THE FORM HAS TO BE UM IT HAS TO </s>
IT'S HAS TO BE POSSIBLE TO STAND UP </s>
OR JUST ONLY TO LIE DOWN </s>
AND THE THE COVER OF THE THE DOCKING STATION IS ALSO </s>
ON TOP OF THE TELEVISION THEN </s>
OR NOT </s>
AND YOU CAN JUST YEAH THEN CLICK IT IN </s>
THAT'S OKAY </s>
UM SO THE INTERFACE </s>
WHAT TYPE OF INTERFACE DO WE WANT TO USE </s>
UM MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE A LITTLE DRAWING OF IT ON THE </s>
ON THE THE BOARD </s>
DOES SOMEBODY HAVE IDEAS FOR A FORM OR </s>
YEP </s>
MM </s>
USABILI YEAH EASE OF USE WILL BE A LOT MORE DIFFICULT AND THEN IT'S </s>
BUT YOU HAVE EXTRA BUTTONS </s>
SO PEOPLE CAN GET CONFUSED </s>
ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE THE SAME WRITINGS ON IT </s>
CAN'T WE MAKE UH CAN'T WE MAKE A REMOTE WHICH YOU CAN FLIP OVER AND USE </s>
ON THE SAME </s>
FUNCTIONS AS THE NORMAL ONE </s>
THEN YOU HAVE TO </s>
LET'S SEE IF I CA </s>
A BLANK ONE </s>
AND THEN YOU GET </s>
HERE'S A LITTLE L. C. D. SCREEN </s>
UH NOW I HAVE TO THINK </s>
IT'S A PLUS AND A MIN </s>
NO IT'S NOT VERY HANDY I THINK </s>
BECAUSE THE PLUS AND THE MIN WILL BE OPPOSITE AND ALL KINDS OF </s>
NO THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK </s>
I GUESS </s>
MAYBE WE SHOULD YEAH </s>
BUT IS IT A PROBLEM THAT LEFT HANDED PERSONS USE A DIFFERENT HAND </s>
I THINK THE FUNCTIONS ARE </s>
THAT BASIC THAT NOBODY SHOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH UH CHOOSING A CHANNEL OR </s>
Y YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
I THINK WE COULD JUST UH LEAVE IT A NORMAL SHAPE </s>
UH BUT MAYBE WE HAVE TO </s>
MAKE IT A L A BIT MORE FANCY </s>
IN ONE OR ANO ANOTHER WAY </s>
YEAH </s>
UM YEAH JUST </s>
YEAH </s>
EASIER </s>
'KAY </s>
I SUGGEST UM THE SINGLE CURVED BECAUSE MAYBE THE CURVE IS PRETTY GOOD TO PUT THE THE SCREEN IN </s>
UH SO THAT ELDERLY PEOPLE CAN UH USE THE REMOTE CONTROL AND AT THE SAME TIME LOOK EASILY AT THE SCREEN </s>
BECAUSE IT'S A BIT IT HAS A BIT OF A ANGLE </s>
YEAH </s>
I THINK SO </s>
YEAH </s>
BUT NOW IT'S </s>
DO YOU HAVE IT UPSIDE DOWN OR DO YOU HAVE IT THIS THAT'S TOP </s>
OKAY </s>
YEAH </s>
SO GET YOUR MOUSE </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S A GOOD ONE </s>
BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER TO PUT THE SCREEN UH ON TOP </s>
SO JUST FLIP IT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES AROUND THEN YOU GET HERE </s>
IF YOU CAN HAVE THIS ONE YOU TURN IT LIKE THIS </s>
AND THEN FLIP IT UPSIDE DOWN </s>
BECAUSE UH MAYBE YOUR HAND IS IN THE WAY IF YOU HAVE THE DISPLAY HERE </s>
I THINK I </s>
ON TOP </s>
YEAH </s>
SO THEN WE GET </s>
HERE'S THAT'S THE CURVE </s>
HERE THE DISPLAY AND THEN BUTTONS </s>
YEAH AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OFF HERE AND HERE MAYBE </s>
JUST THAT'S FOR LEFT HAND AND RIGHT HAND USERS </s>
AND THEN H THE REST OF THE BUTTONS OVER HERE </s>
YEAH STILL HERE JUS </s>
THAT'S </s>
YEAH </s>
SHOULD BE MORE BIT MORE FRIENDLY YEAH </s>
'KAY </s>
SUPPLEMENTS </s>
THAT'S OKAY </s>
WHERE'S MY MOUSE </s>
THEN </s>
WE'VE GOT A GENERAL IDEA OF THE CONCEPTS AND THE MATERIALS WE'RE GOING TO USE </s>
SO NOW FOR THE NEXT MEETING UH WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN </s>
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE CORPORATE DESIGN IMAGE UH IS GOING TO BE IN THE REMOTE </s>
SO CHECK OUT THE CORPORATE WEBSITE MAYBE </s>
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN IT'S THE SAME STORY </s>
AND PRODUCT EVALUATION </s>
SO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND USER INTERFACE DESIGNER ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ONE </s>
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR INSTRUCTIONS I THINK SENDED BY THE COACH </s>
SO JUST UM I WILL PUT THESE UM MINUTES ON THE IN THE FOLDER </s>
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO UH TRY TO FINISH OUR PROJECT AND UH MAKE A GOOD DESIGN FOR ALL THE GRANDFATHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS I THINK </s>
WHICH ARE UH LET'S SEE </s>
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE GOING TO START RIGHT AWAY TO WORK TOGETHER OR I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FILL IN THE QUESTIONNAIRES FIRST </s>
AND THEN YOU'LL GET A MESSAGE </s>
SO THAT'S UH BASICALLY IT </s>
MAYBE THIS ONE </s>
THEN WE CAN SAVE THIS ONE IN THE </s>
FOLDERS GROUP </s>
UH YES IT'S HERE </s>
SMARTBOARD THERE IT IT </s>
SO IF YOU WANNA HAVE A LOOK AT IT IT'S OVER THERE IN THE PROJECTS FOLDER </s>
AND THEN I GUESS WE'LL START IN THIRTY MINUTES AGAIN </s>
THANK YOU </s>
NO </s>
MM NO </s>
UM 'KAY UM YEAH </s>
UH SOME UH RESEARCH UH A ABOUT UM DESIGNING OF AN INTERFACE </s>
UM THE UH LAST MEETING UH WE HAD A ABOUT UM UH USING A F FEW BUTTONS </s>
SO UH UM UH THAT'S W WHAT I WHAT I WANT TO UH </s>
UH TO DO IN UH OUR DESIGN </s>
SO UM FINDING AN ATTRACTIVE UH WAY TO CONTROL UH THE REMOTE CONTROL </s>
UM THE UH I FOUND SOME UH SOMETHING ABOUT UH SPEECH UH RECOGNITION </s>
SO MAYBE UH WE CAN UH USE UH THAT </s>
UM </s>
UH AND UH USING A LITTLE UH DISPLAY </s>
SO UM FINDINGS </s>
UM YEAH JUST UM WE HAVE JUST TO FOCUS ON THE PRIMARY UM FUNCTIONS </s>
SO UH ONLY UH BUTTONS UH FOR UH SOUND UM FOR UH ON OFF UM UH SHIFTING U UP UH SA UH CA CHANNEL OR UH DOWN SHIFTING DOWN </s>
UM UH LET'S SEE </s>
UM YEAH AND </s>
UH WE UH NEED SOME UH NEW A ATTRACTIVE FUNCTIONS UH UH WHICH ATTRACT UH UH PEOPLE FOR USING IT </s>
SO UH IT'S UH LIKE A SPEAK UH SPEECH UH RECOGNITION AND UM A SPECIAL BUTTON FOR SELECTING UH SUBTITLES </s>
JUST UH WHAT WE UH MENTIONED UH LAST UH MEETING </s>
UM AND YEAH OVERALL UM USER FRIENDLY </s>
SO UH USING UH LARGE LARGE BUTTONS </s>
UM </s>
IT'S UH POSSIBLE TO UH UH TO MAKE UM QUITE CHEAP UH SYSTEM FOR UH SPEECH UH RECOGNITION </s>
UM YOU CAN THINK ABOUT UM UH WHEN YOU LOST YOUR UM REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN UH CALL IT AND UM IT GIVES AN UM SIG SIGNAL </s>

UM </s>
LET'S SEE </s>
UH YEAH </s>
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE SPECIAL UH BUTTON FOR UH SUBTITLES UM JUST ONE BUTTON TO KEEP IT UH SIMPLE </s>
UH ONE PUSH ON THE BUTTON UH YOU GET UH UH SMALL UH SUBTITLES </s>
UM DOUBLE PUSH PUSH UM IF DOUBLE CLICK UM SO UH YOU GET UH BIG UH SUBTITLES FOR UH PEOPLE UH </s>
UM UH WHICH C F UH WHO CAN'T UH READ SMALL UH SUBTITLES </s>
SO UH UM </s>
YEAH AND W WE HAVE TO KEEP UH IN GENERAL BUTTONS UH SO UM WE'VE GOT UM THE BUTTONS WE HAVE TO USE </s>
THE ON OFF SOUND ON OFF SOUND HIGHER OR LOWER UM THE NUMBERS UH ZERO TO UH UH NINE </s>
UM THE GENERAL BUTTONS M MORE GENERAL B ONE BUTTON FOR SHIFTING UP AND SHIFTING DOWN UH CHANNEL </s>
UM ALSO WE WANT TO UH USE A LITTLE D DISPLAY UH FOR UM FOR DISPLAYING THE UH THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BUTTONS </s>
AND UM WE CAN UH BUILD IN A FUNCTION F WHICH UH SHOWS THE CHANNEL OR SOME UH WHICH THE T TELEVISION IS ON </s>
SO UM MADE A LITTLE UH PICTURE OF UH IT </s>
UM </s>
SEE </s>
UM YEAH </s>
JUST UM WE CAN PUT UH THE ON OFF BUTTON UH OVER IN THIS UH CORNER </s>
UM ALMOST UH E ALL UH REMOTE CONTROLS UH ARE USING A ON OFF BUTTON ON THAT PLACE </s>

UH WE CAN MAKE IT UM MM </s>
THAT'S THE TOP </s>

UH IT'S AN </s>

OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
ABOUT THE COMPONENTS DESIGN </s>
UM FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE WE CAN USE A BASIC BATTERY OR A AS AN OPTIONAL THING </s>
A KINETIC ENERGY LIKE IN A WATCH WHICH YOU JUST SHAKE AND IT PRODUCES ENERGY </s>
BUT IF WE CHOOSE FOR THAT OPTION THE DOCKING STATION WOULD C BECOME OBSOLETE </s>
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY AN OPTION </s>
UH FOR THE CASING UH THE UH MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT CAN DELIVER UH A FLAT CASING SINGLE OR DOUBLE CURVED CASING </s>
IT'S REALLY UP THE THE DESIGN THAT WE'RE GONNA USE </s>
IT'S UH DOESN'T UH IMPLY ANY TECHNICAL RESTRICTIONS </s>
UH AS A CASE SUPPLEMENT WE COULD UM I THOUGHT OF THAT L LATER UH A RUBBER UH BELT LIKE A ANTI SLIP </s>
UH FOR THE B BUTTONS WE CAN USE PLASTIC OR RUBBER </s>
AND THE CHIP SET UM IT SAYS SIMPLE HERE BUT IT SHOULD BE ADVANCED BECAUSE WE'RE USING AN L. C. D. UH SCREEN </s>
AND AS UH THE TREND WATCHER PRESENTATION SHOWED UM PEOPLE LIKE WOOD </s>
BUT IT RAISES THE PRICE AND IT DOESN'T REALLY FIT THE IMAGE UNLESS WE WOULD START TWO PRODUCT LINES </s>
FORM SHOULD FOLLOW FUNCTION OVERALL </s>
UM WELL THE KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE IS RATHER FANCY </s>
BUT DEPENDS ON WHAT WE WANT </s>
I THINK WE SHOULD DISC DISCUSS THAT </s>
UM FOR THE CASE UH THE SUPPLEMENT AND THE BUTTONS IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE DESIGNER </s>
AND THE CHIP SET UH REALLY SHOULD BE ADVANCED BECAUSE OTHERWISE UH IT WOULD REALLY BE A SIMPLE UH REMOTE CONTROL </s>
AND THAT'S IT </s>
YES W THERE THERE ARE FOUR OPTIONS </s>
WE COULD USE THE BASIC NORMAL BATTERY </s>
UH A HAND DYNAMO </s>
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY AN OPTION </s>
YOU DON'T WANNA SWING BEFORE YOU CAN WATCH TELEVISION </s>
UH SOLAR CELLS </s>
BUT NOT EVERY ROOM IS VERY LIGHT SO IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD OPTION </s>
OR THE KINETIC ENERGY </s>
WELL Y YOU BASICALLY SHAKE YOUR REMOTE AND THEN IT POWERS UP </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S TRUE </s>
MM I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON PRICING </s>
SO I'LL HAVE TO ASK THE MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT </s>
BUT THAT WOULD ALSO GO FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN THEN I GUESS </s>
IT'S A BIT HIGHER PERCENTAGE BUT </s>
OKAY </s>
AND THAT'S THE BEST CHOICE </s>
WELL THERE ISN'T ANY CHOICE THERE BECAUSE WE'RE USING THE THE THE THE DISPLAY </s>
SO IT'S GOTTA BE ADVANCED </s>
MM I DUNNO </s>
I'LL HAVE TO UH RESEARCH </s>
YES </s>
YES </s>
WELL THE THE GENERAL LIKE MOST OLDER REMOTES ARE FLAT JUST STRAIGHT </s>
AND UH OUR D MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT CAN ALSO DELIVER SINGLE CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED CA CURVED CASES </s>
UM IT WOULD JUST ONLY AFFECT THE FORM FOR AS FAR AS I KNOW </s>
SO IT'S J REALLY JUST UP TO THE DESIGN DEPARTMENT WHAT WE'RE GONNA USE </s>
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER FOR THE PRICE OR THE FUNCTIONALITY </s>
PICK ONE YOU LIKE YES </s>
YEAH </s>
I THINK WE SHOULD START BY BY CHOOSING A CASE </s>
BECAUSE THAT'S THE BASIS YOU'RE BUILDING ON </s>
SO I COULD DRAW THEM OUT </s>
LET'S LOOK AT THE FLAT CASE </s>
OH </s>
IT'S FROM THE SIDE SO IT'S RATHER NORMAL </s>
THE THE SINGLE CURVED SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS </s>
SO THIS TYPE SHOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU OR BETTER SHOULD PREVENT REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY A BIT </s>
AND THE DOUBLE CURVED S LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS I GUESS </s>
SO TH THOSE ARE THE THREE OPTIONS WE HAVE </s>
YEAH </s>
IT'S MORE LOGICAL TO HAVE IT ON TOP AS WELL BECAUSE LIKE ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE IT'S ALWAYS ABOVE </s>
OH MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST S START ON A BLANK PAGE </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
GOOD AFTERNOON </s>
SURE </s>
I'LL START OFF THEN </s>
DOH </s>
'KAY I'M UH GONNA INFORM YOU ABOUT THE TREND WATCHING I'VE DONE OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS </s>
UM WE'VE DONE SOME MARKET RESEARCH </s>
WE DISTRIBUTED SOME MORE ENQUETES QUESTIONNAIRES </s>
AND UM BESIDES THAT UM I DEPLOYED SOME TREND WATCHERS TO MILAN AND PARIS TO WELL GET ALL OF THE NEWEST TRENDS </s>
AND I'VE CONSULTED SOME ADDITIONAL TREND WATCH TREND WATCHERS AFTER THE ORIGINAL TREND WATCHERS RETURN ABOUT WHAT THE </s>
THE BEST DESIGN WOULD BE </s>
UM OKAY THESE ARE SOME OVERALL FINDINGS </s>
UM MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE FANCY DESIGN </s>
UM THE RESEARCH INDICATED THAT THAT WAS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR </s>
UM INNOVATIVENESS WAS ABOUT HALF AS IMPORTANT AS THE FANCY DESIGN </s>
BY INNOVATIVENESS THIS MEANS UM FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE NOT FEATURED IN OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS </s>
UM ABOUT HALF OF HALF AS IMPORTANT AS THE INNOVATIVENESS WAS THE WAS EASY TO USE </s>
UM FOR OUR UM GROUP WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE PEOPLE OF SIXTY TO EIGHTY Y YEARS OLD THIS IS UM THESE FACTORS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE EQUAL </s>
'KAY THESE ARE SOME MORE GROUP SPECIFIC FINDINGS </s>
UH THE OLDER PEOPLE PREFER DARK COLOURS </s>
UH THEY LIKE RECOGNISABLE SHAPES AND FAMILIAR MATERIAL </s>
AND OUR SURVEYS HAVE INDICATED THAT ESPECIALLY WOOD IS PRETTY MUCH </s>
THE MATERIAL FOR OLDER PEOPLE </s>
UM THIS IS THIS IMAGE WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN IMPRESSION ABOUT UM THE LOOK AND FEEL THAT UM THE REMOTE SHOULD HAVE </s>
UM THIS LEADS US TO SOME PERSONAL PREFERENCES </s>
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE DOCKING STATION SHOULD UH BLEND IN IN THE </s>
IN THE ROOM </s>
UM SO THIS WOULD MEAN NO UH EYE CATCHING DESIGNS </s>
JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE AND WELL THE DOCKING STATION AND SMALL SCREEN WOULD BE OUR MAIN POINTS OF INTEREST </s>
BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE THE THESE WOULD UH BE THE INNOVATIVENESS IN THE REMOTE CONTROL </s>
SO THIS WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE AT LEAST INCLUDE THESE FEATURES </s>
UM WELL THE TREND WATCHERS I CONSULTED ADVISED THAT IT B SHOULD BE THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE DOCKING STATION SHOULD BE TELEPHONE SHAPED </s>
SO YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL BE STANDING UP STRAIGHT IN THE DOCKING STATION </s>
THIS IS NOT REALLY THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A NEW SHAPE TO UH OLDER PEOPLE </s>
SO THEY WOULD PREFER UH A DESIGN WHERE THE REMOTE CONTROL JUST LIES FLAT IN THE DOCKING STATION </s>
SO IT WOULD BE KINDA MORE TELEPHONE SHAPED </s>
UM BESIDES THAT WE WOULD ADVISE UM TO BRING TWO EDITIONS ONE WITH A WOOD LIKE COLOUR AND MAYBE FEEL AND ONE WITH A GREY BLACK COLOUR </s>
THE WOOD LIKE FOR THE MORE UH EXCLUSIVE PEOPLE </s>
PEOPLE WITH MORE MONEY </s>
UH THE GREY BLACK COLOUR FOR WELL </s>
PEOPLE WITH LESS MEANS </s>
THAT WOULD BE ALL </s>
ANY QUESTIONS </s>
AND HOW EXACTLY DOES THE KINETIC ENERGY WORK </s>
YOU JUST </s>
YOU USE IT AND IT WORKS </s>
OKAY </s>
WELL PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK THAT OLDER PEOPLE LIKE TO SHAKE THEIR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE THEY USE IT </s>
AND BESIDES THAT YOU MENTIONED IT WOULD MAKE THE DOCKING STATION OBSOLETE </s>
AND I THINK OUR DOCKING STATION COULD BE ONE OF THE MARKETING ISSUES WITH WHICH WE CAN UM </s>
GET GREAT POPULARITY FOR OUR PRODUCT </s>
UM WEL </s>
YEAH YOU COULD LOAD UP THE BATTERIES YOU COULD UM INSERT THE FIND THE LOST REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTION IN THERE </s>
THAT'S TRUE </s>
I'M WONDERING UM WHAT WILL THE VOICE RECOGNITION MEAN FOR THE PRODUCTION PRICE </s>
'CAUSE IN OUR EARLIER UM MARKET RESEARCH IF YOU'D ALLOW ME TO GO TO THE FLAT BOARD SMARTBOARD </s>
UM SO IT WAS OPEN HERE </s>
UM WE ALSO UM </s>
ASKED IF W THEY WOULD IF PEOPLE WOULD PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL </s>
WELL YOU CAN SEE HERE OUR TARGET GROUP WOULD NOT DO THAT </s>
SO IF THAT WOULD INCREASE THE PRICE FOR WHICH WE'RE SELLING OUR REMOTE CONTROL </s>
I WOULD GREATLY ADVISE NOT TO DO IT </s>
I THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER TO UH INSERT IN OUR OTHER PRODUCT THAT IS MEANT FOR THE </s>
YOUNGER PEOPLE </s>
UM WELL THIS IS YEAH BUT THIS IS HERE THE QUESTION WAS WOULD YOU PREFER IT </s>
SO THAT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN THEY WOULDN'T PAY EXTRA FOR IT </s>
AND ON TOP OF THAT THE L. C. D. SCREEN WOULD UM HELP IN MAKING THE REMOTE CONTROL EASIER TO USE </s>
AND I THINK A VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTION WOULD NOT MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL MUCH EASIER TO USE </s>
UM WELL THIS WAS FOR LIKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE ON A ON THE THE MOST ADVANCED MOBILE PHONES </s>
SO PRETTY LARGE </s>
'KAY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
WELL AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR THERE IS THE WOODEN COLOUR </s>
SO IT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE WOOD IF IT'S JUST </s>
WOOD COLOURED </s>
PROBABLY </s>
YEAH THAT IS TRUE </s>
YEAH </s>
WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK CAREFULLY INTO THE DESIGN THOUGH </s>
'CAUSE WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE ONE W UH CONTROL WHICH WOULD FIT IN WITH A WOODEN COVER AND A </s>
PLASTIC COVER </s>
THE MORE ORIGINAL ONE OR THE MORE STANDARD ONE </s>
SO THAT WOULD </s>
WELL I WOULDN'T DESIGN A TELEPHONE BUT </s>
WELL NO I THINK W WE SHOULD JUST WE SHOULD THEN JUST DESIGN ONE UM </s>
ONE REMOTE BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE FANCY WITH EITHER THE WOOD COVER OR THE PLASTIC ONE </s>
SO BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM </s>
UM I HEARD OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TALK ABOUT UH FLAT SINGLE AND DOUBLE CURVED </s>
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE MORE </s>
MM-HMM </s>
AND WHAT WOULD SINGLE CURVED AND DOUBLE CURVED MEAN </s>
OKAY </s>
SO WE CAN PRETTY MUCH JUST DO WHATEVER WE WANT </s>
'KAY </s>
THAT'S GOOD </s>
NO JUST TO LIE DOWN </s>
WE'LL GO FOR THAT </s>
WELL OR BESIDES IT </s>
MM-HMM </s>
UM YOU UH SAID YOU WANTED TO PUT THE UM CHANGING CHANNELS BUTTON ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO YOU COULD </s>
SO YOUR THUMB WOULD BE EASILY WELL UH I THINK THAT WAS A VERY GOOD POINT 'CAUSE I POINTED OUT EARLIER THAT A LOT OF REMOTES CAUSE R. S. I. </s>
SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THAT </s>
UM I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD JUST MAKE ONE OF THOSE BUTTONS ON BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SIDE </s>
FOR LEFT HANDED USERS ALSO </s>
FOR THE VOLUME </s>
UM WELL THAT COULD </s>
YEAH WE COULD DO THAT BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR THE EASY EASE OF USE </s>
BUT IF WE WOULD MAKE UM A CHANGING CHANNELS AND CHANGING VOLUME BUTTON ON BOTH SIDES THAT WOULD CERTAINLY YIELD GREAT OPTIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE </s>
'CAUSE IT COULD BE MADE ALL SYMMETRICAL AND STUFF </s>
THAT IS TRUE </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT IS TRUE </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
AND I'D PREFER THE CORNERS TO BE ROUND </s>
THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER </s>
FRIENDLY ON THE EYE </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
VERY GOOD </s>
SO </s>
HELLO </s>
NO PROBLEM </s>
OKAY </s>
THAT'S POSSIBLE ON UH THIS TIME OF DAY </s>
STARTS AT THREE O'CLOCK </s>
UH UH LET ME SEE </s>
OUR FOURTH AND LAST MEETING </s>
THERE HE IS </s>
YES </s>
OKAY THIS OUR LAST MEETING </s>
IN THIS MEETING WE WILL DISCUSS OUR FINAL DESIGN </s>
AND WE WILL DO SOME EVALUATION ABOUT THE NOT ONLY THE PRODUCT BUT ALSO THE PROJECT </s>
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE PROJECT TODAY AS WELL </s>
SO AFTER THIS YOU WILL BE UH FREE TO GO AND UH SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY </s>
AND THIS UH DESIGN DETAILED DESIGN MEETING UH WE WILL DISCUSS UH THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE DESIGN </s>
THE USABILITY INTERFACE DESIGN AND WE WILL DO THE PRODUCT EVALUATION </s>
UM IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE THIS AGENDA </s>
WE'LL HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION FIRST </s>
THEN WE WILL SET UP SOME EVALUATION CRI UM CRITERIA </s>
THEN WE WILL LOOK AT THE FINANCE </s>
UH WE WILL HAVE TO SEE IF EVERYTHING WE WANNA DO IS ALSO POSSIBLE WITHIN OUR BUDGET </s>
BECAUSE EVERYTHING COSTS MONEY AND THE MORE FUNCTIONS YOU WANNA HAVE THE MORE MONEY IT WILL COST </s>
SO WE HAVE TO SEE IF IT FITS WITHIN THE TWELVE AND A HALF EURO PER REMOTE </s>
BUT WE WILL SEE THAT LATER </s>
THEN WE WILL DO THE PROJECT UH EVALUATION AND THE CLOSING AFTER THAT </s>
WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES </s>
SO WE WILL BE FINISHED AT HALF PAST THREE </s>
BUT FIRST UM </s>
WE WILL DO THE THIS IS PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION </s>
SO IF SOME YEAH IF SOMEBODY WANTS STEP FORWARD </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
UH BUT UM I THOUGHT IN A FEW MEETINGS EARLIER WE UH UH TRIED TO KEEP IT UH SIMPLE </s>
UH JUST A FEW BUTTONS AND LARGE BUTTONS </s>
BUT UH I THINK THESE ARE ALTOGETHER QUITE A QUITE A FEW BUTTONS </s>
SO I'M WONDERING IF WE IF WE NEELY REALLY NEED ALL OF THOSE BUTTONS </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
MM </s>
LONG TIME </s>
YEAH </s>
IF YOU PUT </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
YEAH </s>
UH TELETEXT AND SUBTITLES ARE YEAH NECESSARY </s>
OKAY </s>
YEP </s>
OKAY </s>
SO WE HAD SOMEBODY ABOUT TH INTERFA SOMETHING ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUTTONS THERE </s>
JUST N NORMAL PLAIN BUTTONS </s>
YEAH </s>
'KAY </s>
NO </s>
NO </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
YEP </s>
OKAY </s>
THAT'S NICE </s>
THEN BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY MINUTES LEFT I WILL MOVE ON TO THE FINANCE PART </s>
WHICH IS PRETTY EXCITING TO SEE IF IT'S ALL POSSIBLE WHAT WE WANNA DO </s>
AND I CAN TELL YOU </s>
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRETTY HARD TIME PRODUCING THIS FOR TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS </s>
IF WE SEE I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE FILLED IN CORRECTLY SO JUST CORRECT ME IF YOU SEE UH SOMETHING WRONG </s>
I COUNTED TWO BATTERIES </s>
BUT MAYBE WE CAN ALSO USE ONE </s>
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE </s>
IT'S RECHARGEABLE </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
OKAY </s>
THAT'S TWO EUROS OFF </s>
WE NEED THE ADVANCED CHIP </s>
SO THERE'S NOT MUCH TO UH </s>
TO SAVE THERE </s>
HERE WE HAVE THE SINGLE CURVES </s>
UH WE CAN SEE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNCURVED AND THE SINGLE CURVED IS ONE EURO </s>
UM </s>
I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK THE SINGLE CURVED IS GOOD FOR DESIGN AND ALSO FOR THE DISPLAY TO HAVE A PROMINENT PLACE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL </s>
I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT </s>
THEN WE HAVE THE CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENTS </s>
IT'S PLASTIC </s>
IT'S THE CHEAPEST ONE WE NEED </s>
SO THAT'S UH NOT MUCH TO SAVE EITHER </s>
BUT THEN THE BIGGEST COSTS ARE THE BUTTONS </s>
SO MAYBE WE REALLY SHOULD TRY TO DISCARD SOME BUTTONS TO UH KEEP OUR COSTS LOW </s>
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WE WILL HAVE TO GET THE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS AT THE END </s>
UM </s>
SO IF WE LET'S FIR FIRST COUNT THE BUTTONS WE HAVE NOW </s>
BECAUSE I SIXTEEN </s>
NAH THAT WILL BE EVEN MORE THEN </s>
EIGHTEEN EUROS </s>
SO </s>
SEVENTEEN </s>
OKAY INCLUDING THE HELP </s>
YEAH </s>
UH SEVENTEEN </s>
I THINK WE CAN UH DISCARD THE HELP AND THE MUTE BUTTON </s>
UH BY PRESSING DOWN VOLUME LONG OR PRESSING DOWN A A NUMBER </s>
LONG </s>
THAT SAVES US UH ONE EURO ALREADY </s>
'CAUSE THEN WE HAVE GOT FIFTEEN I THINK </s>
FIFTEEN BUTTONS </s>
AND THIS IS </s>
NO THOSE ARE ONE I THINK </s>
YEAH BUT TH IT'S NOT STATED IN THIS FILES </s>
SO MAYBE WE CAN WE CAN EVEN MAKE ONE BUTTON WITH THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL IN ONE BY PRESSING </s>
THAT'S POSSIBILITY AS WELL </s>
SO AND IT'S GOOD FOR THE DESIGN AS WELL </s>
SO YOU CAN MAKE </s>
UH LET'S SEE </s>
IF YOU MAKE THIS </s>
LOOKS A BIT LIKE UH </s>
A CROSS </s>
PLUS </s>
MIN </s>
UH S YEAH CHANNEL </s>
YEAH W </s>
YEAH TH I THINK THEY COUNT UH THE MATERIALS </s>
YEAH ON THE CHIP THERE </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
BUT I THINK BECAUSE WE HAVE THE ADVANCED CHIP WE CAN JUST COUNT THIS AS ONE BUTTON </s>
BUT NO BUT I THINK </s>
YEAH </s>
MAYBE IT IS BUT THEN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS </s>
ALSO THE L. C. DISPLAY I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE DISPLAY WE USE </s>
I THINK THEY UH TRY T </s>
THAT'S RIGHT BUT WHAT'S THE BIG ADVANTAGE OF OUR REMOTE THEN </s>
YEAH </s>
NO </s>
THAT'S EXTRA </s>
THAT'S EXTRA </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
THAT'S AN OPTION </s>
POLAND </s>
SOMETHING </s>
POLISH SUPPLIER </s>
DON'T YOU THINK WE CAN IF WE CAN COUNT THIS AS V AS ONE BUTTON </s>
AND INTEGRATE TH UH THESE BUTTONS IN THREE THEN WE SAVE A LOT OF MONEY AS WELL </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S A POINT </s>
YEP </s>
NO </s>
YEAH BUT UH WE HAVE TO STICK TO THE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS </s>
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE BUDGET TO DEVELOP IT </s>
YEAH </s>
SO </s>
IT IS </s>
IF YOU LEAVE OUT THE L. C. DISPLAY </s>
AND IF YOU USE LESS BUTTONS </s>
SAY OR YOU CAN TAKE THE SINGLE CHIP </s>
THERE IT IS </s>
BUT THEN W </s>
GOOD LOOKING </s>
YEAH </s>
I THINK IT'S UH DIFFICULT AS WELL BUT </s>
OR WE CAN LEAVE OUT THE TEN BUTTONS AND TAKE ONE SCROLL WHEEL FOR THE PROGRAMME NUMBERS </s>
THEN W </s>
BECAUSE THEN WE SAVE TEN BUTTONS </s>
THEN WE HAVE FIVE AND ONE </s>
AND AND SEE </s>
IF WE HAVE THIS ONE AND WE'VE GOT THE ADVANCED </s>
W UH WE'RE GETTING CLOSE </s>
THEN YOU WILL </s>
OR MAYBE YOU CAN </s>
UM SCROLL </s>
IF YOU SCROLL YOU WILL SEE THE NUMBERS ON THE L. C. D. DISPLAY </s>
UNTIL YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER THEN YOU PUSH IT </s>
ALRIGHT </s>
IT'S GOTTA SCROLL AND PUSH </s>
OKAY BUT THEN YOU YOU CAN PUSH UH SOME OTHER BUTTON AS WELL </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
SO IF YOU SCROLL TO A NUMBER AND THEN YOU WAIT A HALF SECOND THEN IT G TURNS TO THAT CHANNEL </s>
BUT IT WOULD DEFINITELY CROP COST A LOT </s>
AND WE NEED THE BATTERY </s>
AND THE REGULAR CHIP IS NOT POSSIBLE </s>
IT HAS TO BE ADVANCED </s>
IT HAS TO BE ADVANCED </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
AND WE CAN SAVE A EURO BY A FLAT DESIGN </s>
THAT'S AN OPTION WE CAN THEN WE'RE ALMOST THERE </s>
YEAH </s>
SO IF WE </s>
YEAH BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT IS A BIG ADVANTAGE IF WE'RE </s>
BUT </s>
CAN WE USE CAN'T WE INTEGRATE THE TELETEXT AND THE SUBTITLES IN ONE BUTTON </s>
IF YOU PUSH IT THREE TIMES </s>
YEAH </s>
AH THAT'S NOT REALLY THAT </s>
NO </s>
I THINK IF YOU MAKE A GOOD ADVERTISEMENT UH ON TELEVISION AND IN THE IN THE GUIDE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE HOW TO USE THE SCROLL WHEEL </s>
IF YOU JUST MAKE IT REAL SIMPLE </s>
BECAUSE IT SAVES IT SAVES A LOT OF MONEY </s>
AND WE CAN KEEP OUR L. C. D. SCREEN WHICH CAN PROVIDE EXTRA INFORMATION </s>
HOW TO USE THE SCROLL WHEEL </s>
HOW TO USE THE OTHER BU BUTTONS AS SUBTITLES </s>
AND IT'S GOOD FOR THE INNOVATIVE DESIGN AS WELL </s>
IF YOU WOULD ERASE THESE </s>
MM ERASER </s>
AND WE PUT UH </s>
LOOKS A BIT ODD MAYBE </s>
THAT IS </s>
SOMETHING LIKE THAT </s>
THEN YEAH </s>
WE'VE GOT THE SCROLL WHEEL </s>
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE BUTTONS IF WE ERASE THIS ONE </s>
AND THESE ARE TWO BUTTONS THEN </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S REALLY A GOOD GOOD IDEA I THINK </s>
AND IT WILL MAKE THE USE OF THE SCROLL WHEEL UH MORE OBVIOUS INDEED </s>
SO WE MAKE ONE FOR THE VOLUME ONE FOR THE CHANNEL </s>
PLUS SCROLL </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
SO WE'VE GOT ONE TWO THREE </s>
YEAH WE CAN LEAVE THE TELETEXT IN IF WE WANT </s>
THAT'S M THAT'S BETTER </s>
Y YEAH </s>
MM YEAH </s>
UH YEAH AND THEN YOU CAN </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
SO WE CAN </s>
DECREASE THIS ONE TO FOUR BUTTONS </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S NO PROBLEM </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
IT'S UH IT'S MORE THE MOULDS IN WHICH THEY ARE BEING MADE I THINK </s>
SINGLE CURVED IS REALLY EASY TO JUST FILL IN </s>
AND CASES COME RIGHT OUT OF THE MACHINE </s>
AND SINGLE CURVED YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT UH DIFFERENT MACHINE THAN A FLAT ONE </s>
I THINK THIS IS A REALLY EASY ONE </s>
UM </s>
WHAT DOES EVERYBODY THINK ABOUT A FLAT OR A SINGLE CURVED DESIGN </s>
FREEK WHAT DO YOU THINK </s>
YEAH </s>
YEP </s>
WE HAVE TO CUT COSTS </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH I'M AG </s>
ASK FOR MORE MONEY </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
I AM AGREEING WITH THE USABILITY </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
BUT TH UM I THINK WE CAN THEN KEEP THE SINGLE CURVED ONE </s>
JUST TO EXPRESS OUR L. C. D. SCREEN A BIT MORE </s>
SO PEOPLE WILL USE IT MORE AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE HELP FUNCTIONS IT WILL BE GOOD IF WE HAVE SCROLL BAR SCROLL BUTTON </s>
IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO HAVE GOOD HELP FUNCTION AS WELL </s>
SO THIS IS SCROLL </s>
I THINK IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE THIS PRICE LIST A BIT EARLIER </s>
BEFORE WE WENT ON TO THE TO THE WHOLE DESIGN </s>
BUT </s>
I'M GLAD WE COULD MAKE A BIT </s>
IT'S PRETTY DIFFERENT IF YOU SAW THE LAST ONE THAN THIS ONE </s>
YEAH </s>
IT WILL </s>
YEAH </s>
NO BUT I THINK </s>
I THINK THE MOST </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
WE CAN LET L WE CAN STICK IT OUT A BIT </s>
LIKE A OLD OLD BUTTONS </s>
MAYBE THAT'S RECOGNISABLE FOR THEM AS WELL </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S A GOOD ONE </s>
SO I'M AFRAID WE HAVE TO MOVE ON </s>
AND IT'S UH IT'S B UH LESS FRIGHTENING I THINK </s>
IF THEY SEE THIS DESIGN THEY THINK OH THERE ARE ONLY FIVE BUTTONS AND UH BUT WE WILL SEE </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S DEFINITELY RIGHT </s>
YEAH </s>
I WOULD BUY IT </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
I WOULD BUY IT IF I WAS SIX </s>
NO I DON'T KNOW </s>
WHAT IT COSTS UNDER TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS </s>
NO </s>
UH YES THEY ARE </s>
NO </s>
BUT WE CAN GO ON WITH THE PROJECT EVALUATION </s>
LET'S SEE </s>
I CAN SIT DOWN I THINK </s>
WE STILL HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT SO WE'RE NICE ON SCHEDULE </s>
UM THE PROJECT PROCESS </s>
EVALUATION CRITERIA </s>
THAT'S RIGHT </s>
THAT WAS THE THE POINT I FORGOT </s>
I SHOULD </s>
THERE WE ARE </s>
EVALUATION CRITERIA </s>
GO AHEAD </s>
WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES I THINK FOR THOSE CRITERIA </s>
NO WE'VE GOT FIFTEEN MINUTES BUT </s>
UH YES </s>
UH YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
YEAH THAT'S BECAUSE MY PEN FAILED TO UPLOAD HIS DATA </s>
I TRIED TO BUT IT'S UH IT'S GIVING ERRORS BY DOWNLOADING THE SOFTWARE </s>
I THINK IT'S FANCY </s>

THEN WE HAVE TO DO THE THREE </s>
IT'S THE </s>
YES IT IS </s>
YEAH </s>
AND THEY WANNA PUT FASHION IN THEIR PRODUCTS </s>
UH IN THE SLOGAN OF THE COMPANY </s>
AND WE HAVE THE REMOVABLE FRONT CASES </s>
SO I THINK IT'S VERY RECOGNISABLE </s>
YEP </s>
WE'VE GOT A CALCULATE IT </s>
MM </s>
N WE'VE GONNA WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE IT </s>
FORTY NINE </s>
FORTY ONE </s>
THAT'S </s>
AROUND EIGHTY PERCENT </s>
WHAT IS IT </s>
THAT'S EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT </s>
I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY NICE SCORE </s>
OKAY </s>
THANK YOU </s>
SO </s>
THAT BRINGS US TO THE PROJECT EVALUATION </s>
YEP </s>
THANK YOU </s>

DO WE </s>
DOCKING STATION </s>
THAT'S A GOOD POINT </s>
BUT MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE DOCKING STATION THE PRICE OF THE REMOTE CAN ALSO BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER </s>
UH AND I THINK YOU CAN COMPENSATE THAT AS WELL </s>
SO I THINK THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S VERY CHEAP TO MAKE AS WELL </s>
DO WE THINK WE GONNA GET THE TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION </s>
OR WHAT WAS IT </s>
FIFTEEN FIFTEEN MILLION </s>
I THINK WE WILL </s>
IF WE GONNA EXPORT THIS PRODUCT </s>
IT'S INNOVATIVE </s>

JUST PUT IT ON THE MARKET FOR EVERYBODY </s>
YOU CAN YOU CAN CHANGE MARKETS WHERE BY CHANGING THE FRONT COVERS </s>
THAT'S ONE THING YOU CAN CHANGE IT WITH </s>

UH MAYBE UH THEY WILL SAVE IT </s>
SO UH </s>
OKAY </s>
UH MAYBE WE HAVE TO FILL UH ANOTHER QUESTIONNAIRE </s>
SO UH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
WELL THIS IS WHAT ME AND RICHARD CAME UP WITH </s>
THE DEFAULT SPOT FOR THE ON OFF BUTTON </s>
THE MUTE BUTTON JUST BELOW THAT </s>
THEN THERE'S THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL SELECTORS </s>
SIMPLE PLUS MINUS BUTTON </s>
UH WE THOUGHT OF A HELP BUTTON </s>
IF YOU HOLD IT AND YOU PRESS ANOTHER BUTTON UH THE HELP GOES TO THE L. C. D. SCREEN </s>
THEN THERE'S THE ZERO TO ONE TO ZERO BUTTONS </s>
A BUTTON FOR TELETEXT </s>
A BUTTON FOR THE SUBTITLES </s>
AND THE COMPANY LOGO </s>
SO IT'S RATHER SIMPLE PROTOTYPE </s>
AND UH WE'LL HAVE TO SEE FROM TESTING UH HOW THE USERS TAKE IT </s>
SURE UH JUST POP IN AT ANY TIME </s>
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT </s>
MOST CONTROLS THEY'VE GOT MORE BUTTONS THAN THIS </s>
AND WELL THE ON OFF BUTTON IT'S IT'S A NECESSITY </s>
YOU CAN'T DROP THAT ONE </s>
THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL BUTTONS YOU NEED YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED THOSE THOSE </s>
THE MUTE BUTTON COULD BE REPLACED UH BY PRESSING THE VOLUME DOWN BUTTON TWICE </s>
SO WE COULD CANCEL THAT ONE </s>
I THINK THE HELP BUTTON REALLY IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO KNOW WHEN SOMEONE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT A BUTTON DOES </s>
WELL YOU CAN'T </s>
LEAVE OUT THE NUMBER BUTTONS I GUESS </s>
AND </s>
YEAH </s>
SO IT'S RATHER BASIC ALREADY </s>
YEAH THEY'RE IT'S RATHER HARD TO DRAW ON THE WHITE BOARD </s>
BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE EQUAL SIZED ROUND WITH A WITH A LITTLE LOGO ON IT FOR THE FOR THE VOLUME THE THE TRIANGLE AND STUFF </s>
JUST FOR RECOGNITION </s>
SO AND FOR THE MATERIALS WE'VE JUST CHOSEN FOR RUBBER BUTTONS </s>
WITH A A DIFFERENT COLOUR THAN THE CASE </s>
SO THEY JUMP OUT </s>
AND UH THAT'S ABOUT IT </s>
YEP </s>
YES </s>
YEP </s>
YEP </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YES </s>
UH THAT'S THAT'S A BIG COST </s>
IF WE LEAVE OUT THE DISPLAY WE CAN ALSO SAVE MONEY ON THE CHIP </s>
WHICH ISN'T THE THE DOCKING STATION ISN'T EVEN IN THIS C S SCHEMATIC </s>
SO IT'S NOT EVEN TAKEN INTO THE PRICE </s>
WE WE COULD SAVE MONEY ON IT </s>
BUT WOULD IT MAKE THE REMOTE MORE USABLE FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE </s>
MY MOTHER CAN'T EVEN SEND SEND AN S. M. S. MESSAGE </s>
SO </s>
YEAH </s>
THE MARGIN WILL GET TOO SMALL </s>
YEAH </s>
TEN </s>
NO REMOTE </s>
THAT'S </s>
WE'RE GETTING CLOSER </s>
YEAH </s>
YOU COULD JUST NOT SCROLL FOR A HALF A SECOND </s>
SO YOU WON'T NEED A BUTTON </s>
IF YOU WANT TO USE AN L. C. D. SCREEN YOU YOU NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP YES </s>
YEP </s>
YEAH IF YOU V COULD JUST LEAVE OUT ONE MORE BUTTON </s>
YEAH </s>
I THINK SO </s>
YEAH </s>
WHAT IF YOU HAVE TO SCROLL TO PAGE EIGHTY EIGHT </s>
EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT </s>
YEAH </s>
OKAY </s>
NO </s>
WE COULD MAKE TWO BUTTONS OUT OF THAT </s>
AND JUST UM </s>
IF YOU PRESS THE VOLUME BUTTON YOU CAN CONTROL THE VOLUME WITH THE SCROLL WHEEL </s>
SO THAT WOULD SAVE TWO BUTTONS </s>
IF YOU DO THE SAME FOR THE CHANNEL </s>
MORE OBVIOUS </s>
SO IF WE </s>
YEAH </s>
SO </s>
IF WE LEAVE OUT ALL THOSE BUTTONS PERHAPS YOU CAN GO WITH THE FLAT FLAT CASE </s>
AND MAKE IT SMALLER OVERALL </s>
SO IF YOU PUT THE THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL BUTTONS ON THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE ON OFF BUTTON THE SCREEN RIGHT BEHI UNDER THAT THAN THE SCROLL BUTTON </s>
YOU GET A A MUCH SMALLER REMOTE </s>
AND IT </s>
SH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
RICHARD'S ARGUMENT WAS VERY GOOD </s>
YEAH </s>
YEP </s>
YEAH </s>
SIX </s>
YEAH </s>
FOUR OR FIVE </s>
YES </s>
NO </s>
MM WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF THAT ONE </s>
I THINK THAT'S A THREE </s>
I STILL I THINK IT'S TOO M TOO FANCY </s>
TOO TOO FLASHY </s>
TWENDAG SIEVEN AN TWENDAG </s>
YEAH </s>
YES </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S TRUE </s>
YEAH THERE W THERE WAS ENOUGH ROOM BUT THE FINANCE UH </s>
YES </s>
YES WAS OKAY </s>
THE TASKS ARE VERY STRUCTURED SO YOU CAN JUST DO STEP BY STEP AND IT'S VERY EASY </s>
WELL THE SMART BOARD THE D D DRAWING IS JUST A PAIN IN THE ASS BUT </s>
THE DIGITAL THE DIGITAL PEN IS VERY NICE </s>
YES </s>
YEAH </s>
A FLIP OVER OR A MORE PRECISE UH </s>
DIGIT YES </s>
NO </s>
DIDN'T WORK </s>
YES </s>
YEAH </s>
CONSIDERING WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE A DOCKING STATION </s>
PERHAPS </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
GOOD AFTERNOON </s>
SORRY I'M A LITTLE LATE </s>
GOT STUCK IN THE TRAFFIC </s>
YEAH </s>
UM IS THIS THE MOMENT WHERE WE ASK OR CAN ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUNCTIONALITY </s>
UM WHEN YOU'RE IN TELETEXT THERE USUALLY ARE BUTTONS WHERE YOU JUST YOU JUST PRESS IT AND YOU G GO TO THE NEXT TELETEXT PAGE </s>
MM-HMM </s>
OKAY </s>
OKAY </s>
UM </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
THINK SO </s>
THAT'S WHAT I POINTED OUT EARLIER </s>
IF YOU JUST MAKE A CONTROL FOR JUST THE T. V. THERE'S JUST NOT MUCH TO GAIN HERE </s>
SINCE IT RECHARGEABLE </s>
UM </s>
DAMN </s>
WOULDN'T YEAH </s>
NO </s>
THAT WOULDN'T BE AN OPTION </s>
UH D I ASSUME YOU'D COUNT THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL THINGIES FOR TWO BUTTONS EACH RIGHT </s>
WELL THINK ACTUALLY THERE'RE TWO BUTTONS AREN'T THEY </s>
WELL I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU COULD JUST INTEGRATE THREE OF THOSE NUMBERS TO ONE BUTTON </s>
THAT WOULD CUT THE COST </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
BUT I THINK THIS REALLY IS FOUR BUTTONS ANYHOW </s>
YES </s>
ONLY THE DOCKING STATION I GUESS </s>
MAYBE WE SHOULD TO A DIFFERENT SUPPLIER </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING </s>
UM </s>
WELL SINCE THE MARKET RESEARCH </s>
INDICATED THAT OLDER PEOPLE SPEND THEIR MONEY EASIER MORE EASY MAYBE IT'S FEASIBLE TO JUST PUT THE PRICE OF THE REMOTE UP A LITTLE </s>
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE THOSE NICE FEATURES </s>
IT WOULD BE A BE A PRETTY RIGID ONE </s>
OR B </s>
BASICALLY BECOMING A CHOICE BETWEEN LIKE EITHER A GOOD REMOTE AND A HIGHER PRODUCTION COST OR JUST ANY OTHER REMOTE CONTROL </s>
BUT HOW DOES SCROLL WHEEL WORK HERE </s>
THAT WOULD BRING UP THE PRICE OF THE SCROLL WHEEL ALSO </s>
INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON </s>
BUT YEAH </s>
I THINK THAT WOULD BE LIKE THE END OF OUR USABILITY </s>
YEAH BUT </s>
WELL THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE TELETEXT SUBTITLES ARE RIGHT NOW YOU JUST PUSH THE TELETEXT BUTTON GO TO PAGE EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT AND TELETEXT DISAPPEARS </s>
BUT THE SUBTITLES STAY THERE </s>
I THINK THAT'S THE CASE ON MOST </s>
WELL THAT COULD BE JUST UH LIKE THE SCROLL TO EIGHT CLICK SCROLL TO EIGHT CLICK SCROLL TO EIGHT CLICK </s>
BUT THEN AGAIN THAT WOULD BE D J JUST PRETTY MUCH NOT AN OPTION FOR OLDER PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A SCROLL WHEEL IS </s>
HOLDING A </s>
REMOTE WITH WHICH THEY EXPECT TO HAVE LIKE TEN BUTTONS FOR THE NUMBERS ONE TO ZERO </s>
WITH ONLY FIVE BUTTONS ON IT </s>
AND A SCROLL WHEEL </s>
TRUE </s>
TRUE </s>
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG SCROLL WHEEL </s>
SO THIS IS FIVE BUTTONS </s>
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FIVE </s>
MM </s>
WELL I STILL THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR THE SINGLE CURVE DESIGN </s>
BUT THEN AGAIN </s>
ALL THESE CHANGES ARE NOT REALLY OKAY WITH ME </s>
BUT SINCE </s>
WE JUST HAVE TO </s>
I'D RATHER JUST GO TO THE BOARD AND </s>
GET US TO SPEND EIGHTEEN DOLLARS A A REMOTE </s>
OR DO SOME MARKET RESEARCH AND SEE WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE </s>
YEAH </s>
YES </s>
DEFINITELY </s>
YEAH </s>
IT'S PRETTY DIFFERENT </s>
BUT THIS IS NOT REALLY LIKE FOR THE GROUP WE WERE MAKING OUR REMOTE </s>
THIS WILL REALLY REQUIRE A LOT OF MARKETING </s>
TO GET THIS TO SELL </s>
'CAUSE IF OLDER PEOPLE LIKE FAMILIAR FORMS AND FAMILIAR STUFF </s>
THIS IS NOT FAMILIAR FOR THEM </s>
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A LOTTA CONVINCING THEM </s>
YEAH </s>
THAT'S TRUE </s>
MIGHT UH MIGHT BE CONFUSING TOO </s>
THEY'D BE LIKE WHAT </s>
ONLY FIVE BUTTONS </s>
YEAH </s>
BUT YOU'RE NOT SIXTY </s>
MM-HMM </s>
SO UM I LIKE SET UP ALL THESE CRITERIA </s>
AND EVALUATION OF THE </s>
THINGY </s>
THANK YOU </s>
FIVE MORE MINUTES </s>
OKAY </s>
'KAY SO I DID SOME LITERATURE STUDY STUDY AND ANALYSIS OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE SET UP EARLIER </s>
TRANSLATED IT INTO CRITERIA WHICH WOULD BE THESE </s>
UM IS THE REMOTE FANCY </s>
THE SHAPE LOOK AND FEEL </s>
INNOVATIVE </s>
WHAT NEW FUNCTIONS ARE THERE </s>
UH EASY TO USE </s>
UH LEARNABILITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR HERE </s>
UH IS IT FUNCTIONAL </s>
ARE THERE NOT TOO MANY FUNCTIONS UH AMONG THE FUNCTIONS </s>
AND ARE THE THOSE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE THERE ARE THEY USEFUL </s>
AND THE COST </s>
THE TARGET GROUP </s>
IS THE REMOTE REALLY FOR THE GROUP WE'RE MAKING IT FOR </s>
AND RECOGNABILITY </s>
IF OUR COMPANY IS IF IT IS EASILY RECOGNISABLE THAT OUR COMPANY MADE IT </s>
AND </s>
SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO EVALUATE IT RIGHT NOW </s>
LET'S SEE </s>
OH I HAVE TO SAY THIS WAS A LITTLE HARD BECAUSE THE MINUTES OF OUR LAST MEETING </s>
WERE NOT HERE </s>
OKAY </s>
INTERESTING </s>
SO </s>
IS THE DESIGN FANCY ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN </s>
WE ALL GO FOR SIX </s>
GOOD </s>
UM IS THE DESIGN INNOVATIVE </s>
I THINK SO WITH OUR L. C. D. SCREEN DOCKING STATION SCROLL BUTTONS </s>
SEVEN </s>
SHOULD BE DO ABLE </s>
IS THE DESIGN EASY TO USE </s>
WELL </s>
WOULD BE FOR US </s>
BUT </s>
I'D GO FOR FOUR TOO </s>
IS THE DESIGN FUNCTIONAL </s>
UM DO WE HAVE ALL FUNCTIONS THAT WE WANT TO INCLUDE </s>
I THINK WE DO </s>
DO WE HAVE TOO MANY FUNCTIONS </s>
I DON'T THINK SO </s>
IT'S PRETTY SLIM </s>
SEVEN </s>
OH AND DO WE UM </s>
TAKE CARE OF THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL </s>
LIKE IT GETTING LOST AND </s>
R. S. I. INFLUENCES </s>
THINK WE DO </s>
ARE THE PRODUCTION COSTS WITHIN THE PRESET LIMITS </s>
WELL THEY ARE NOW </s>
DOES THE DESIGN FIT THE GROUP OF FOCUS </s>
YEAH </s>
I THINK IT DOESN'T </s>
I DON'T KNOW </s>
I THINK </s>
I THINK A RADIO BUTTON IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT OLDER PEOPLE EXPECT TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL </s>
I'M NOT SURE </s>
I THINK I'D GO FOR TWO </s>
'KAY </s>
IS THE COMPANY COMPANY RECOGNISABLE </s>
WELL WE HAVE THE LOGO THERE </s>
SO </s>
YEAH </s>
SO THAT WILL BE THIS </s>
I WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO CALCULATE THE SCORE BUT </s>
THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE ANOTHER PRIVATE THINGY AFTER THIS </s>
IS THIS LIKE AFTER THIS ARE WE DONE </s>
OR </s>
WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR OTHER ROOM AGAIN </s>
WELL ANYHOW </s>
THESE ARE SEVEN FACTORS TIMES SEVEN IS FORTY </s>
SOMETHING </s>
TWO </s>
NO </s>
NINE </s>
UH MINUS ONE </s>
MINUS THREE MINUS FOUR </s>
MINUS FOUR </s>
SO THAT WOULD BE MINUS EIGHT </s>
FORTY ONE OUT OF FORTY NINE </s>
OKAY </s>
GUESS I'LL JUST TYPE THAT IN ON THE BOTTOM HERE </s>
HMM </s>
'KAY </s>
SO THAT WILL BE THE EVALUATION </s>
THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A SHOULD HAVE HAD THE FINANCE THINGY A LOT EARLIER </s>
IN THE DESIGN PHASE </s>
YEAH </s>
DEFINITELY </s>
NO </s>
NOT TOO MUCH </s>
NO </s>
YEAH TRUE </s>
BUT </s>
AND I WOULD'VE LIKED TO GO FOR THE </s>
YOUNGER USERS ALSO </s>
AND JUST TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS INTERNET AND </s>
GET SOMETHING OF YOUR OWN </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH I TRIED TO OPEN THE FILE ON MY LAPTOP BUT </s>
NOT POSSIBLE </s>
YEAH </s>

MM </s>
YEAH </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
THEY ARE </s>
YEAH </s>
FIFTY GRAND </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH STILL I THINK I MEAN IF WE'RE N GONNA MAKE A SCROLL BUTTON ANYWAY </s>
IT'D BE MORE FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE THAN FOR THE OLDER PEOPLE </s>
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST RE FOCUS </s>
OR SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE </s>
THAT'S TRUE </s>
YEAH I THINK THEN IT WOULD BE WAY MORE UH POPULAR WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE THAN IT IS THAN WOULD BE WITH </s>
OLDER PEOPLE </s>
EVEN IF IT WERE THEIR COVERS </s>
BUT </s>
PARTY PARTY </s>
'KAY </s>
OH YOU DID </s>
MM-HMM </s>
YEAH </s>
YEAH IT PROBABLY WILL </s>
OH YEAH YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE A FINAL </s>
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GO INTO OUR OWN ROOMS AGAIN </s>

THAT'D BE NICE </s>
